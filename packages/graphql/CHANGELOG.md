### Patch Changes

-   [#3890](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/3890) [`6d434108f`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/6d434108ff2b88f265945586d8958aa6a40ce771) Thanks [@darrellwarde](https://github.com/darrellwarde)! - Fix: authorization checks are no longer added for the source nodes of connect operations, when the operation started with a create. The connect operation is likely required to complete before the authorization rules will be satisfied.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - It was possible to define schemas with types that have multiple relationship fields connected by the same type of relationships. Instances of this scenario are now detected during schema generation and an error is thrown so developers are informed to remedy the type definitions.

    An example of what is now considered invalid with these checks:

    ```graphql
    type Team {
        player1: Person! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
        player2: Person! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
        backupPlayers: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Person {
        teams: [Team!]! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
    ```

    For more information about this change and how to disable this validation please see the [4.0.0 migration guide](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/guides/v4-migration/)

A callback function returning these is also accepted. This is a reduction from `TypeSource` which also included types such as `GraphQLSchema` and `DefinitionNode`, which would have resulted in unexpected behaviour if passed in.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - Removed deprecated argument `plural` from `@node` directive.

This are either redundant, or internals which shouldn't have been exported.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - Remove unused `DeleteInfo`, `GraphQLSortArg`, `GraphQLOptionsArg` and `GraphQLWhereArg` type exports.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - Programmatic toggling of debug logging is now done using the `debug` option of the constructor.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - Change subscriptions setup, this requires changes to constructor options passed to Neo4jGraphQL. See <https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/guides/v4-migration/#subscriptions-options>

    For single instance subscriptions use `true`:

    ```javascript
    const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
        typeDefs,
        features: {
            subscriptions: true,
        },
    });
    ```

    For any other plugin, pass it `features.subscriptions`:

    ```javascript
    const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
        typeDefs,
        features: {
            subscriptions: subscriptionPlugin,
        },
    });
    ```

The `boomkark` field in the selection set has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in version `5.0.0` of the library.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - The `requires` argument of the `@customResolver` directive now accepts a graphql selection set. This means it is now possible to require non-scalar fields such as related types.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - `@cypher` directive now requires the parameter `columnName`.

    This requires all cypher queries to be made with a valid alias that must be referred in this new parameter.

    For Example:

    **@neo4j/graphql@3**

    ```
    @cypher(statement: "MATCH (i:Item) WHERE i.public=true RETURN i.name")
    ```

    **@neo4j/graphql@4**

    ```
    @cypher(statement: "MATCH (i:Item) WHERE i.public=true RETURN i.name as result", columnName: "result")
    ```

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - `neo4jDatabaseInfo` has been removed from the context. It is our belief that this has little utility in the library. If you regularly use different drivers connected to _different versions_ of Neo4j and require this feature, please raise an issue: https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/issues/new/choose

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - The `@id` directive has had a number of breaking changes.

    The `unique` argument has been removed. In an effort to simplify directives, `@id` will now only only be responsible for the autogeneration of UUID values.
    If you would like the property to also be backed by a unique node property constraint, use the `@unique` directive alongside `@id`.

    The `autogenerate` argument has been removed. With this value set to `false` and the above removal of constraint management, this would make the directive a no-op.

    The `global` argument has been removed. This quite key feature of specifying the globally unique identifier for Relay was hidden away inside the `@id` directive. This functionality has been moved into its own directive, `@relayId`, which is used with no arguments. The use of the `@relayId` directive also implies that the field will be backed by a unique node property constraint.

    Note, if using the `@id` and `@relayId` directive together on the same field, this will be an autogenerated ID compatible with Relay, and be backed by a single unique node property constraint. If you wish to give this constraint a name, use the `@unique` directive also with the `constraintName` argument.

This is to simplify the API and to remove any unexpected behaviours from arguments which we blindly pass through.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - All labels and field names are escaped in the generated Cypher

If you were using backticks in the `type` argument of your `@relationship` directives, these should now be removed to avoid backticks being added into your relationship type labels.

-   [#2773](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/pull/2773) [`7462b9715`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/commit/7462b97158bb7a202a77ec389270151e8d49cfb3) Thanks [@angrykoala](https://github.com/angrykoala)! - `cypherQueryOptions` moved into context-only, as a per-request option.

Instances of this scenario are now detected during schema generation and an error is thrown so developers are informed to remedy the type definitions.

    An example of what is now considered invalid with these checks:

    ```graphql
    type Team {
        player1: Person! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
        player2: Person! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
        backupPlayers: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Person {
        teams: [Team!]! @relationship(type: "PLAYS_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
    ```

See <https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/guides/v4-migration/#subscriptions-options>

    For single instance subscriptions use `true`:

    ```javascript
    const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
        typeDefs,
        features: {
            subscriptions: true,

    This requires all cypher queries to be made with a valid alias that must be referred in this new parameter.

    For Example:

    **@neo4j/graphql@3**

    ```
    @cypher(statement: "MATCH (i:Item) WHERE i.public=true RETURN i.name")
    ```

    The `@authentication` directive is used to configure authentication checks at either the schema, object or field level:

    ```graphql
    type Post @authentication(operations: [CREATE]) {
        content: String!
    }
    ```

    The `@authorization` directive is used to configure fine-grained authorization against node properties:

    ```graphql
    type User @authorization(validate: [{ where: { node: { id: "$jwt.sub" } } }]) {
        id: ID!
    }
    ```

    The `@subscriptionsAuthorization` directive is used to configure fine-grained authorization specifically for Subscriptions events:

    ```graphql
    type Post @subscriptionsAuthorization(filter: [{ where: { node: { author: "$jwt.sub" } } }]) {
        likes: Int!
    }
    ```
