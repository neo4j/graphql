Tests private fields are not included in the schema.

### Simple

**TypeDefs**

```typedefs-input
type User {
    id: ID
    password: String @private
}
```

**Output**

```schema-output
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to run the specified Cypher statement in order to resolve the value of the field to which the directive is applied."""
directive @cypher(
  """The Cypher statement to run which returns a value of the same type composition as the field definition on which the directive is applied."""
  statement: String!
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to completely ignore a field definition, assuming that it will be fully accounted for by custom resolvers."""
directive @ignore on FIELD_DEFINITION
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to only expose a field through the Neo4j GraphQL OGM."""
directive @private on FIELD_DEFINITION
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to exclude a field from the generated input types for the object type within which the directive is applied."""
directive @readonly on FIELD_DEFINITION
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to only include a field in the generated input types for the object type within which the directive is applied, but exclude it from the object type itself."""
directive @writeonly on FIELD_DEFINITION
