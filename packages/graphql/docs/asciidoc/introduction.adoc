= Introduction

This is an introduction to the Neo4j GraphQL mapping library (@neo4j/graphql). It also outlines requirements and where to get support.
If you are already familiar with @neo4j/graphql, feel free to jump directly to <<reference>>.


== Requirements

@neo4j/graphql 1.0.x at minimum, requires:

-   [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) Database 4.1.0 and above.

-   [Apoc](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/) 4.1.0 and above


== Additional Resources

-   Version Control - https://github.com/neo4j/graphql
-   Bug Tracker - https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/issues


== What is neo4j/graphql ?

GraphQL to Cypher query execution layer for Neo4j and JavaScript GraphQL implementations. This library makes it easier to use Neo4j and GraphQL together. Translating GraphQL queries into a single Cypher query means users do not need to understand the Cypher Query language & can let the library handle all the database talking.

Using this library users can focus on building great applications while just writing minimal backend code.


=== Goals of @neo4j/graphql

-   Provide an abstraction for GraphQL developers ontop of Neo4j.

-   Enable the integration with common community library's and tools.


== What's the difference from `neo4j-graphql-js` ?

> Checkout the original Neo4j GraphQL implementation [here](https://grandstack.io/)

When using the new library you will feel right at home, we have taken familiar fundamentals and concepts from neo4j-graphql-js and extended them. This library @neo4j/graphql is a fully supported Neo4j product. Here we look at the changes in the two implementations and also suggest some ways to migrate over to the new library.


=== New features

The latest and greatest stuff exclusive to this new implementation.


==== Nested mutations

Use nested mutations to perform operations such as; create a post and connect it to an author, with just one GraphQL call leads to ultimately one database trip;

[source, graphql]
----
mutation {
    createPosts(
        input: [
            {
                title: "nested mutations are cool"
                author: { connect: { where: { name: "dan" } } }
            }
        ]
    ) {
        posts {
            id
        }
    }
}
----


==== `@auth`

Define complex, nested & related, authorization rules such as; “grant update access to all moderators of a post”.

[source, graphql]
----
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
}

type Post @auth(rules: [
  {
    allow: [{ moderator: { "id": "sub" }}], # "sub" being "req.jwt.sub"
    operations: ["update"]
  }
]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  moderator: User @relationship(type: "MODERATES_POST", direction: "IN")
}
----

==== OGM

We created an OGM(Object Graph Model) on top of the pre-existing GraphQL work and abstractions. Generate your normal GraphQL schema & use the exposed .model method to receive an instance of a model.

[source, javascript]
----
import { OGM } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import * as neo4j from "neo4j/driver";

const typeDefs = `
   type Genre {
      name: String
   }

   type Movie {
      id: String
      name: String
      genres: [Genre] @relationship(type: "HAS_GENRE", direction: "OUT")
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", neo4j.auth.basic("admin", "password"));

const ogm = new OGM({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
});

const Movie = ogm.model("Movie"); // Hi I am your model

await Movie.find({ where: { id: "123" } });
// Nested Mutations
await Movie.create({
    input: [
        {
            title: "Saw",
            genres: { create: [{ name: "Horror" }] },
        },
    ],
});
----

=== Excluded features

Features we have chosen to exclude for the first version of @neo4j/graphql:

==== Relationship Properties
We found the existing implementation [here](https://grandstack.io/docs/graphql-relationship-types/), where you have to use the 'top-level' relation directive;

[source, graphql]
----
type Rated @relation(name: "RATED") {
    ....
}
----

Tricky to reason about.
Before adding this feature back in we want to explore some more expressive ideas and take any community feedback on board.
**The library doesn't know the concept of relationship properties** meaning you cannot; create, read, or filter by properties on a relationship.

==== Top level unions
In `neo4j-graphql-js` users could query top-level Unions such as;

[source, graphql]
----
union Search = Genre | Movie
----

[source, graphql]
----
query {
	Search {
		... on Genre {}
		... on Movie {}
	}
}
----

In the new implementation, **you cannot do this.** We made this decision on the fact that we had to create nodes with multiple labels causing issues.
**You can use unions on a `@relationship`.**

==== Interface querying
Similar to the reasons states in the Top Level Unions... we found that adding multiple labels onto a node can sometimes cause more problems it's trying to solve plus if you take into consideration the complexity. In the version, **users cannot query top-level Interfaces Nor use them as a `@relationship`.** In this implementation interfaces give you no real database support therefor no; query, update, delete, filter support. But instead used as a language feature to safeguard your schema. Great for When dealing with repetitive or large schemas you can essentially put "The side railings up".

==== Further Excluded Features
1. Additional Labels
1. GraphQL Architect
1. Indexes and Constraints
1. Inferring a Schema
1. Federation Support - We found federation very specific to Apollo users & not beneficial for our greater audience
