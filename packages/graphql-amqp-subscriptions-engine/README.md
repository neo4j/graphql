# @neo4j/graphql-amqp-subscriptions-engine

Subscription plugin for `@neo4j/graphql`, currently supporting AMQP 0-9-1 brokers such as:

* RabbitMQ
* Apache Qpid
* Apache ActiveMQ

[Documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/subscriptions/)

## Installation

```
npm install @neo4j/graphql-amqp-subscriptions-engine
```

## Usage

```javascript
const { Neo4jGraphQLAMQPSubscriptionsEngine } = require("@neo4j/graphql-amqp-subscriptions-engine");

const plugin = new Neo4jGraphQLAMQPSubscriptionsEngine({
    connection: {
        hostname: "localhost",
        username: "guest",
        password: "guest",
    },
});

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    plugins: {
        subscriptions: plugin,
    },
});
```

To close the connection with RabbitMQ:

```javascript
await plugin.close();
```

## Options

The following options are available in the plugin.

* **connection**: [AMQP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib) connection options or amqp url (e.g. `amqp://localhost`).
* **exchange**: (optional) Queue exchange, defaults to `neo4j.graphql.subscriptions.fx`.
* **reconnectTimeout**: (optional) Timeout (in ms) between reconnection attempts. If not set, the plugin will not reconnect. Note that if the first connection fails, it will not attempt to reconnect.
* **log**: (optional) Enable AMQP logs, defaults to `true`.
* **amqpVersion**: (optional) AMQP version to use, only `0-9-1` supported at the moment.

## Running tests

* `yarn test` to run unit tests
* `yarn test:e2e` to run integration tests. These tests require a RabbitMQ instance running, and are not run by default
  * Use `docker-compose up rabbitmq` to spin up a RabbitMQ container for testing
  * Use `docker-compose up qpid` to spin up a Qpid container for testing
