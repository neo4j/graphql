# Migration Example

This example application is the full implementation of the example in the blog "Announcing the Stable Release of the official Neo4j GraphQL LibraryÂ 1.0.0". Commits will be made in the stages represented in the blog, with a working example at each commit.

## Getting Started

The dependencies would have been installed by running `yarn` at the root of the repository, or you can install them by running the same command in this directory.

The project can then be run using `yarn start`.
