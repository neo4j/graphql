Export a new type, `Neo4jGraphQLContext` which can be passed into a GraphQL server to provide strong typing when populating the context with values to influence the behaviour of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. For an example of how this might be used, see the [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/context#the-context-function).
