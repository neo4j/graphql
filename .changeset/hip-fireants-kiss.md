feat: Toolbox - major version bump to version 2.0.0

A high-level overview of changes made:

- All the editors are now powered by [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) version 6 and support all the features and functions from the previous version.
- On the query editor page we've introduced tabs to store several queries and mutations. Improved the solution for resizing the different editors (query, variables, and response).
- The favorites on the type definitions page did get an update. It's now possible to order favorites and download them individually.
- Large overhaul of the styling to align with the other Neo4j frontend products.
