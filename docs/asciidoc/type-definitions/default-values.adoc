[[type-definitions-default-values-coalesce]]
== `@coalesce`

When translating from GraphQL to Cypher, any instances of fields to which this directive is applied will be wrapped in a `coalesce()` function in the WHERE clause (see https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/understanding-non-existent-properties-and-null-values/#_use_coalesce_to_use_a_default_for_a_null_value). This helps to query against non-existent properties in a database, however it is encouraged to populate these properties with meaningful values if this is becoming the norm. This is a very primitive implementation of the function which only takes a static default value as opposed to using another property in a node or a Cypher expression.
