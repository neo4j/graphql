= Custom Resolvers

A common case for using the OGM will be within custom resolvers inside a Neo4j GraphQL instance (very meta!), due to the fact that it has access to some fields which the Neo4j GraphQL Library may not. A common use case might be to have a `password` field marked with directive `@private`, and a custom resolver for creating users with passwords.

To get started with this example, create your example application directory, create a new project and also the file which will contain your application code:

[source, bash]
----
mkdir ogm-custom-resolvers-example
cd ogm-custom-resolvers-example
npm init --yes
touch index.js
----

Then you need to install your dependencies:

[source, bash]
----
npm install @neo4j/graphql-ogm graphql neo4j-driver apollo-server
----

Assuming a running Neo4j database at "bolt://localhost:7687" with username "neo4j" and password "password", in your empty `index.js` file, add the following code:

[source, javascript]
----
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const { OGM } = require("@neo4j/graphql-ogm");
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const { createJWT, comparePassword } = require("./utils"); // example util functions

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const typeDefs = `
    type User {
        id: ID @id
        username: String!
        password: String! @private
    }

    type Mutation {
        signUp(username: String!, password: String!): String! ### JWT
        signIn(username: String!, password: String!): String! ### JWT
    }
`;

const ogm = new OGM({ typeDefs, driver });
const User = ogm.model("User");

const resolvers = {
    Mutation: {
        signUp: async (_source, { username, password }) => {
            const [existing] = await User.find({
                where: {
                    username,
                },
            });

            if (existing) {
                throw new Error(`User with username ${username} already exists!`);
            }

            const [user] = await User.create({
                input: [
                    {
                        username,
                        password,
                    }
                ]
            });

            return createJWT({ sub: user.id });
        },
        signIn: async (_source, { email, password }) => {
            const [user] = await User.find({
                where: {
                    username,
                },
            });

            if (!user) {
                throw new Error(`User with username ${username} not found!`);
            }

            const correctPassword = await comparePassword(password, user.password);

            if (!correctPassword) {
                throw new Error(`Incorrect password for user with username ${username}!`);
            }

            return createJWT({ sub: user.id });
        },
    },
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    config: {
        jwt: {
            secret: "secret",
        },
    },
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: neoSchema.schema,
    context: ({ req }) => ({ req }),
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
----

It's important to note the JWT secret being passed into the `Neo4jGraphQL` constructor in this example.

Back in the command line, run the following command to start your server:

[source, bash]
----
node index.js
----

You should see the following output:

[source, bash]
----
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
----

You can execute the `signUp` Mutation against this GraphQL API to sign up, but when you go to query the user through the same API, the password field will not be available.
