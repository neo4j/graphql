= OGM

Common applications won't just expose a single API. On the same instance as the GraphQL API there may be; scheduled jobs, authentication, migrations and not to forget any custom logic in the resolvers themselves. We expose a OGM(Object Graph Model) on top of the pre-existing GraphQL work and abstractions.
