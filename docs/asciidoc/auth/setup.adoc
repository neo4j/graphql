= Setup

== Configuration

If you want the Neo4j GraphQL Library to perform JWT decoding and verification for you, you must pass the configuration option `jwt` into the `Neo4jGraphQL` or `OGM` constructor, which has the following arguments:

- `secret` - The secret to be used to decode and verify JWTs
- `noVerify` (optional) - Disable verification of JWTs, defaults to _false_
- `rolesPath` (optional) - A string key to specify where to find roles in the JWT, defaults to "roles"

The simplest construction of a `Neo4jGraphQL` instance would be:

[source, javascript]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    config: {
        jwt: {
            secret
        }
    }
});
----

It is also possible to pass in JWTs which have already been decoded, in which case the `jwt` option is _not necessary_. This is covered in the section <<auth-setup-passing-in>> below.

=== Auth Roles Object Paths

If you are using a 3rd party auth provider such as Auth0 you may find your roles property being nested inside an object:

[source, json]
----
{
    "https://auth0.mysite.com/claims": {
        "https://auth0.mysite.com/claims/roles": ["admin"]
    }
}
----

In order to make use of this, you must pass it in as a "dot path" into the `rolesPath` option:

[source, javascript]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    config: {
        jwt: {
            secret,
            rolesPath: "https://auth0.mysite.com/claims\\.https://auth0.mysite.com/claims/roles"
        }
    }
});
----

== Passing in JWTs

If you wish to pass in an encoded JWT, this must be included in the `authorization` header of your requests, in the format:

[source]
----
POST / HTTP/1.1
authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJ1c2VyX2FkbWluIiwicG9zdF9hZG1pbiIsImdyb3VwX2FkbWluIl19.IY0LWqgHcjEtOsOw60mqKazhuRFKroSXFQkpCtWpgQI
content-type: application/json
----

Note the string "Bearer" before the inclusion of the JWT.

Then, using Apollo Server as an example, you must include the request in the GraphQL context, as follows (using the `neoSchema` instance from the example above):

[source, javascript]
----
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: neoSchema.schema,
    context: ({ req }) => ({ req }),
});
----

Note that the request key `req` is appropriate for Express servers, but different middlewares use different keys for request objects. You can more details at https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#middleware-specific-context-fields.

=== Decoded JWTs

Alternatively, you can pass a key `jwt` of type `JwtPayload` into the context, which has the following definition:

[source, typescript]
----
// standard claims https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1
interface JwtPayload {
    [key: string]: any;
    iss?: string | undefined;
    sub?: string | undefined;
    aud?: string | string[] | undefined;
    exp?: number | undefined;
    nbf?: number | undefined;
    iat?: number | undefined;
    jti?: string | undefined;
}
----

_Do not_ pass in the header or the signature.

For example, you might have a function `decodeJWT` which returns a decoded JWT:

[source, javascript]
----
const decodedJWT = decodeJWT(encodedJWT)

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: neoSchema.schema,
    context: { jwt: decodedJWT.payload },
});
----

== Auth and Custom Resolvers

You can't use the `@auth` directive on custom resolvers, however, the an auth parameter is injected into the context for use in them. It will be available under the `auth` property. For example, the following custom resolver returns the `sub` field from the JWT:

[source, javascript]
----
const typeDefs = `
    type Query {
        myId: ID!
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        myId(_source, _args, context) {
            return context.auth.jwt.sub
        }
    }
};
----

== Auth and `@cypher` fields

You can put the `@auth` directive on a field alongside the `@cypher` directive. Functionality like `allow` and `bind` will not work but you can still utilize `isAuthenticated` and `roles`. Additionally, you don't need to specify `operations` for `@auth` directives on `@cypher` fields.

The following example uses the `isAuthenticated` rule to ensure a user is authenticated, before returning the `User` associated with the JWT:

[source, graphql]
----
type User @exclude {
    id: ID
    name: String
}

type Query {
    me: User
        @cypher(statement: "MATCH (u:User { id: $auth.jwt.sub }) RETURN u")
        @auth(rules: [{ isAuthenticated: true }])
}
----

In the following example, the current user must have role "admin" in order to query the `history` field on the type `User`:

[source, graphql]
----
type History @exclude {
    website: String!
}

type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
    history: [History]
        @cypher(statement: "MATCH (this)-[:HAS_HISTORY]->(h:History) RETURN h")
        @auth(rules: [{ roles: ["admin"] }])
}
----
