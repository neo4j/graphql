== Quickstart examples

Only authenticated users can create Post nodes:

[source, graphql]
----
type Post @auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE], isAuthenticated: true }
]) {
    title: String!
}
----

Use `extend` to avoid large and unwieldy type definitions:

[source, graphql]
----
type Post {
    title: String!
}

extend type Post @auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE], isAuthenticated: true }
])
----

You can use the directive types as seen in the example above, but you can also apply the directive on any field so as long as it's not decorated with `@relationship`. In the following example, the password field is only accessible to users with role "admin", or the user themselves:

[source, graphql]
----
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}

extend type User {
    password: String! @auth(rules: [
        {
            OR: [{ roles: ["admin"] }, { allow: { id: "$jwt.sub" } }]
        }
    ])
}
----
