In this section you will learn more about how to secure your GraphQL API using Neo4j GraphQL's inbuilt auth mechanics.

> Using auth requires various APOC functions and procedures, one being https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/overview/apoc.util/apoc.util.validatePredicate/[apoc.util.validatePredicate] that is not currently in Neo4j Aura. Run the <<drivers-and-config-checkNeo4jCompat>> method to ensure your Graph has all the requirements.

[source, graphql]
----
type Post @auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE], isAuthenticated: true }
]) {
    title: String!
}
----

When you have production-style Auth the directive can get large and complicated. Use Extend to tackle this;

[source, graphql]
----
type Post {
    title: String!
}

extend type Post @auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE], isAuthenticated: true }
])
----

You can use the directive on 'Type Definitions', as seen in the example above, you can also apply the directive on any field so as long as it's not a `@relationship`;

[source, graphql]
----
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}

extend type User {
    password: String! @auth(rules: [
        {
            OR: [{ roles: ["admin"] }, { allow: { id: "$jwt.sub" } }]
        }
    ])
}
