= Where

Use the `where` argument, on Node definitions, to conceptually append predicates to the Cypher `WHERE` clause. Given the current user ID is "123" and the following the schema;

[source, graphql]
----
type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
}

extend type User @auth(rules: [{ operations: "*", where: { id: "$jwt.id" } }])
----

Then issues a GraphQL query for users;

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

Behind the scenes the userâ€™s ID is **conceptually** prepended to the query;

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users(where: { id: "123" }){
        id
        name
    }
}
----

Where is used on the following operations;

1. read
2. update
3. connect
4. disconnect
5. delete
