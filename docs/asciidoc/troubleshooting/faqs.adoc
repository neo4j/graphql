== I've upgraded from <1.1.0 and my `DateTime` fields aren't sorting as expected

Due to a bug in versions less than 1.1.0, there is a chance that your `DateTime` fields are stored in the database as strings instead of temporal values. You should perform a rewrite of those properties in your database using a Cypher query. For an example where the affected node has label "Movie" and the affected property is "timestamp", you can do this using the following Cypher:

[source, javascript]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE apoc.meta.type(m.timestamp) = "STRING"
SET m.timestamp = datetime(m.timestamp)
RETURN m
----
