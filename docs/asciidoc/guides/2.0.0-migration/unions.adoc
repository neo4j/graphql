= Unions

In this release, we have decided to take the opportunity to overhaul the existing support for unions on relationship fields, to better set us up for adding top-level union support in the future.

All examples in this section will be based off the following type definitions:

[source, graphql]
----
type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Production!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}

type Movie {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Series {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

union Production = Movie | Series
----

== Input types

The structure of input types for union queries and mutations have been changed for user friendliness, and a more consistent API.

Essentially, field names which were previously of template `${unionFieldName}_${concreteType}` (for example, "actedIn_Movie") are now an object, with the field name at the top, and the member types under it.

For example, a Mutation which would have previously been:

[source, graphql]
----
mutation {
    createActors(
        input: [
            {
                name: "Tom Hiddleston"
                actedIn_Movie: {
                    create: [
                        {
                            title: "The Avengers"
                        }
                    ]
                }
                actedIn_Series: {
                    create: [
                        {
                            title: "Loki"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    )
}
----

Will now be:

[source, graphql]
----
mutation {
    createActors(
        input: [
            {
                name: "Tom Hiddleston"
                actedIn: {
                    Movie: {
                        create: [
                            {
                                node: {
                                    title: "The Avengers"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                    Series: {
                        create: [
                            {
                                node: {
                                    title: "Loki"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    )
}
----

Note the change in structure for union input, but also the additional `node` level which enables the use of relationship properties. These changes are consistent across all operations, including `where`.

== Filtering union fields

There has been a slight change to how you filter union fields, adding a `where` level above each union member. For example, for a query which would have used to have looked like:

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    actors {
        name
        actedIn(Movie: { "The Avengers" }) {
            ... on Movie {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This will now be written like:

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    actors {
        name
        actedIn(where: { Movie: { "The Avengers" }}) {
            ... on Movie {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

We feel this has improved readability of queries.

Furthermore, the where argument used now dictates which union members are returned from the database, to prevent overfetching. Please see <<type-definitions-unions-and-interfaces-union-types-querying>> for background and explanation of this decision.
