= Type Definitions

This page will walk through what needs to change in your type definitions before you can pass them into `@neo4j/graphql`.

== Directives

Both `neo4j-graphql-js` and `@neo4j/graphql` are highly driven by GraphQL directives. Each heading in this section will address how/if one or many directives available in `neo4j-graphql-js` can be migrated to `@neo4j/graphql`.

=== `@relation`

Migrating this directive is trivial:

1. Rename `@relation` to `@relationship`
2. Rename the argument `name` to `type`

For example, `@relation(name: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)` becomes `@relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)`.

See <<type-definitions-relationships>> for more information on relationships in `@neo4j/graphql`.

=== Relationship Properties

If for instance using `neo4j-graphql-js`, you have the following type definitions defining an `ACTED_IN` relationship with a `roles` property:

[source, graphql]
----
type Actor {
    movies: [ActedIn!]!
}

type Movie {
    actors: [ActedIn!]!
}

type ActedIn @relation(name: "ACTED_IN") {
    from: Actor
    to: Movie
    roles: [String!]
}
----

This will need to be refactored to the following in the new library:

[source, graphql]
----
type Actor {
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", properties: "ActedIn", direction: OUT)
}

type Movie {
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", properties: "ActedIn", direction: IN)
}

interface ActedIn {
    roles: [String!]
}
----

Note the following changes to the `ActedIn` type:

* Changed from `type` to `interface`
* Removed `@relation` directive
* Removed `from` and `to` fields

And note the following changes to the two node types:

* Relationship field types changed from the relationship type to the neighbouring node type
* Normal `@relationship` directive added to each relationship field, with an additional `properties` argument pointing to the relationship properties interface

=== `@cypher`

No change. See <<type-definitions-cypher>> for more details on this directive in `@neo4j/graphql`.

=== `@neo4j_ignore`

`@neo4j/graphql` offers two directives for skipping autogeneration for specified types/fields:

* <<type-definitions-access-control-exclude>>: Skip generation of specified Query/Mutation fields for an object type
* <<type-definitions-access-control-ignore>>: Ignore a field, which will need custom logic for resolution

=== `@isAuthenticated`, `@hasRole` and `@hasScope`

Will require significant migration, but will be worth the effort! See <<auth>>.

=== `@additionalLabels`

Not supported at this time.

=== `@id`

There is an equivalent directive in the new library, but it does not work using database constraints as per the old library. See <<type-definitions-autogeneration-id>>.

=== `@unique`, `@index` and `@search`

These all relate to database indexes and constraints, which are not currently supported by `@neo4j/graphql`.

== Types

=== Scalar Types

Supported as you would expect, with additional <<type-definitions-types-bigint>> support for 64 bit integers.

=== Temporal Types (`DateTime`, `Date`)

Temporal Types have been massively simplified in `@neo4j/graphql`, down to `DateTime` and `Date`, which use ISO 8601 and "yyyy-mm-dd" strings respectively for parsing and serialization.

In terms of migrating from the old library, the `formatted` field of the old `DateTime` type now becomes the value itself. For example, used in a query:

[source, graphql]
----
{
  Movie(released: { formatted: "1992-10-09T00:00:00Z" }) {
    title
  }
}
----

Has become:

[source, graphql]
----
{
  Movie(released: "1992-10-09T00:00:00Z") {
    title
  }
}
----

Due to the move to ISO 8601 strings, input types are no longer necessary for temporal instances, so `_Neo4jDateTimeInput` has become `DateTime` and `_Neo4jDateInput` has become `Date` for input.

See <<type-definitions-types-temporal>>.

=== Spatial Types

The single type in `neo4j-graphql-js`, `Point`, has been split out into two types:

* <<type-definitions-types-point>>
* <<type-definitions-types-cartesian-point>>

Correspondingly, `_Neo4jPointInput` has also been split out into two input types:

* `PointInput`
* `CartesianPointInput`

Using them in Queries and Mutations should feel remarkably similar.

=== Interface Types

Interface Types are not yet supported in `@neo4j/graphql`. `neo4j-graphql-js` leverages multiple labels for this purpose, which are not yet supported in the new library.

=== Union Types

Supported, queryable using inline fragments as per `neo4j-graphql-js`, but can also be created using Nested Mutations. See <<type-definitions-unions-and-interfaces-union-types>>.

== Fields

=== `_id`

An `_id` field exposing the underlying node ID is not included in each type by default in `@neo4j/graphql` like it was in `neo4j-graphql-js`. If you require this functionality (however, it should be noted that underlying node IDs should not be relied on because they can be reused), you can include a field definition such as in the following type definition:

[source, graphql]
----
type ExampleType {
  _id: ID! @cypher(statement: "RETURN ID(this)")
}
----
