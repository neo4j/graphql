This tutorial walks you through:

- Installing the Neo4j GraphQL Library and its dependencies
- Defining type definitions that represent the structure of your graph database
- Instantiating an instance of the library, which will generate a GraphQL schema
- Running an instance of a server which will let you execute queries and mutations against your schema

This tutorial assumes familiarity with the command line and JavaScript, and also that you have a recent version of Node.js installed. These examples will use the default `npm` package manager, but feel free to use your package manager of choice.

> This tutorial walks through creating a new project with the Neo4j GraphQL Library. If you are not familiar, it will be worthwhile reading up on https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] and https://graphql.org/[GraphQL].

== Step 1: Create a new project

1. Create a new directory and `cd` into it:

[source, bash]
----
mkdir neo4j-graphql-example
cd neo4j-graphql-example
----

2. Create a new Node.js project:

[source, bash]
----
npm init --yes
----

Whilst we're here, let's create an empty `index.js` file which will contain all of the code for this example:

[source, bash]
----
touch index.js
----

== Step 2: Install dependencies

The Neo4j GraphQL Library and it's dependencies must be installed:

- `@neo4j/graphql` is the official Neo4j GraphQL Library package, which takes your GraphQL type definitions and generates a schema backed by a Neo4j database for you.
- `graphql` is the package used by the Neo4j GraphQL Library to generate a schema and execute queries and mutations.
- `neo4j-driver` is the official Neo4j Driver package for JavaScript, of which an instance must be passed into the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

Additionally, we will need to install a GraphQL server package which will host our schema and allow us to execute queries and mutations against it. We will use the popular https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/[Apollo Server] package:

- `apollo-server` is the default package for Apollo Server, which we will pass our generated schema into.

[source, bash]
----
npm install @neo4j/graphql graphql neo4j-driver apollo-server
----

== Step 3: Define your GraphQL type definitions

The Neo4j GraphQL Library is primarily driven by type definitions which map to the nodes and relationships in your Neo4j database. In this example, we'll use a simple example of two node labels, "Actor" and "Movie".

Open up the previously created `index.js` in your editor of choice and write out your type definitions. We'll also add all of our necessary package imports at this stage:

[source, javascript]
----
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const typeDefs = gql`
    type Movie {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor] @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie] @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;
----

These type definitions are incredibly simple, defining the two previously described node labels, and a relationship "ACTED_IN" between the two. When generated, the schema will allow us to execute queries `actors` and `movies` to read data from the database.

== Step 4: Create an instance of `Neo4jGraphQL`

Now that we have our type definitions, we need to create an instance of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. To do this, we also need a Neo4j driver to connect to our database. For a database located at "bolt://localhost:7687", with a username of "neo4j" and a password of "password", add the following to the bottom of our `index.js` file:

[source, javascript]
----
const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
----

== Step 5: Create an instance of `ApolloServer`

The final section of code we need to add is to instantiate an Apollo Server instance using our generated schema, which will allow us to execute queries against it.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.js`:

[source, javascript]
----
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: neoSchema.schema,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
----

== Step 6: Start the server

Finally, we're ready to start up our GraphQL server! Back in the command line, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
node index.js
----

All going well, you should see the following output:

[source, bash]
----
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
----

Where http://localhost:4000/ is the default URL which Apollo Server starts at.

== Step 7: Create your first nodes in the database

We're now ready to add some data to our Neo4j database using our GraphQL API!

Visit http://localhost:4000/ in your web browser and you'll see the following landing page:

image::apollo-server-landing-page.png[title="Apollo Server Landing Page"]

Click "Query your server" which will open the Sandbox.

image::first-mutation.png[title="First Mutation"]

At the moment our database is empty! So let's create a movie and an actor in that movie, all in one Mutation. The Mutation in the screenshot above can also be found below:

[source, graphql]
----
mutation {
  createMovies(
    input: [
      {
        title: "Forrest Gump"
        actors: { create: [{ node: { name: "Tom Hanks" } }] }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    movies {
      title
      actors {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Put this Mutation into the Operations panel and hit the blue "Run" button in the top right. When you execute the Mutation, you'll receive the following response, confirmation that the data has been created in the database!

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "createMovies": {
      "movies": [
        {
          "title": "Forrest Gump",
          "actors": [
            {
              "name": "Tom Hanks"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

We can now go back and query the data which we just added:

image::first-query.png[title="First Query"]

The query we in the screenshot above is querying for all movies and their actors in the database:

[source, graphql]
----
query {
  movies {
    title
    actors {
      name
    }
  }
}
----

We of course only have the one of each, so you will see the result below:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "movies": [
      {
        "title": "Forrest Gump",
        "actors": [
          {
            "name": "Tom Hanks"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
