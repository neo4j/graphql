== Page-based pagination

Page-based pagination can be achieved through the use of the `skip` and `limit` options available whilst querying for data.

Using the following type definition:

[source, graphql]
----
type User {
    name: String!
}
----

You would fetch the first "page" of 10 by executing:

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}
----

And then on subsequent calls, introduce the `skip` argument and increment it by 10 on each call.

Page 2:
[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        skip: 10
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}
----

Page 3:
[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        skip: 20
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}

=== Paginating relationship fields

Say that in addition to the `User` type above, there is also a `Post` type which a `User` has many of. You can also fetch a `User` and then paginate through their posts:

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users(where: {
        name: "Billy"
    }) {
        name
        posts(options: {
            skip: 20
            limit: 10
        }) {
            content
        }
    }
}
