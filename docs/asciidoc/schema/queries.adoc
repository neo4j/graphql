= Queries

Each object defined in type definitions will have a Query field generated for it. Each Query field accepts two arguments:

* `where`: Used to specify the <<schema-filtering>> which should be applied whilst querying the data
* `options`: Used to specify the options for <<schema-sorting>> and <<schema-pagination>>

== Example

Given the following type definitions:

[source, graphql]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post] @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following Query fields will be automatically generated:

[source, graphql]
----
type Query {
    posts(where: PostWhere, options: PostOptions): [Post!]!
    users(where: UserWhere, options: UserOptions): [User!]!
}
----

=== Querying for all Users

The following Query will return all Users, returning their ID and name.

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

=== Query for all Users' Posts

The following Query will return all Users, returning the content which they have posted.

[source, graphql]
----
query {
    users {
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

=== Filtering

See <<schema-filtering>> for details on how data can be filtered whilst querying.
