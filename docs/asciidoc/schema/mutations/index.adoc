== Large Mutations

There is no lie that nested mutations are very powerful. We have to generate complex cypher to provide the abstractions such as `connect` and `disconnect`. Due to the complexity and size of the cypher we generate its not advised to abuse it. Using the Generated GraphQL schema, If you were to attempt the creation of say one hundred nodes and relations at once Neo4j may throw memory errors. This is simply because of the size of the cypher we generate. If you need to do large edits to the graph you may be better using cypher directly, that being said the abstractionâ€™s provided should be fine for most use cases.

> If memory issues are a regular occurrence. You can edit the dbms.memory.heap.max_size in the DBMS settings
