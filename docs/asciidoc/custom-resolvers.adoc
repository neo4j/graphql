= Custom Resolvers

The library will autogenerate Query and Mutation resolvers, so you donâ€™t need to implement those resolvers yourself. However, if you would like additional behaviours besides the autogenerated CRUD operations, you can specify custom resolvers for these scenarios.

== Custom object type field resolver

If you would like to add a field to an object type which is resolved from existing values in the type, rather than storing new values, you should mark it with an <<type-definitions-access-control-ignore>> directive and define a custom resolver for it.

[source, javascript]
----
const typeDefs = `
    type User {
        firstName: String!
        lastName: String!
        fullName: String! @ignore
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    User: {
        fullName(obj) {
            return `${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`;
        },
    },
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
});

== Custom Query/Mutation type field resolver

You can define additional, custom Queries and Mutations in your type definitions and provide custom resolvers for them. A prime use case for this is using the <<ogm>> to manipulate types and fields which are not available through the API.

[source, javascript]
----
const typeDefs = `
    type User {
        userId: ID!
    }

    type Query {
        users: [User]
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        users: () => // implement resolver here
    }
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
});
