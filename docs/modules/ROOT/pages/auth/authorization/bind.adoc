= Bind

Use bind to ensure that on creating or updating nodes, there is equality between a value on the JWT and a property on a matched node. This validation is done after the operation but inside a transaction. Taking a closer look, create a user in your database:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CREATE (:User { id:"user1", name: "one" })
----

For the label and properties of the node created above, the corresponding GraphQL type definitions would be:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}
----

Given the above GraphQL type definition - you could restrict `user1` from changing their own ID:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}

extend type User @auth(
    rules: [
        {
            operations: [UPDATE],
            bind: { id: "$jwt.sub" }
        }
    ]
)
----

After the update or creation of the node, it is validated that the property `id` on the node is equal to the `jwt.sub` property.

Given `user1` has the following decoded JWT:

[source, json, indent=0]
----
{
    "sub": "user1",
    "iat": 1516239022
}
----

When the user makes a request using this JWT to change their ID:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    updateUsers(where: { id: "user1" }, update: { id: "user2" }) {
        users {
            name
        }
    }
}
----

The generated cypher for this query would look like the below, throwing you out of the operation because the `id` property no longer matches.

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
MATCH (u:User { id: "user1" })
SET u.id = "user2"
CALL apoc.util.validate(NOT (u.id = "user1"), "Forbidden")
RETURN u
----

Bind is available for the following operations;

- `READ`
- `UPDATE`
- `CONNECT`
- `DISCONNECT`
- `DELETE`

== `bind` across relationships

There may be a reason where you need to traverse across relationships to satisfy your authorization implementation. One use case could be "ensure that users only create Posts related to themselves":

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
}

type Post {
    content: String
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

extend type Post @auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE], bind: { creator: { id: "$jwt.sub" } } }
])
----

When you specify `bind` on a relationship you can select fields on the related node. It's worth pointing out that `bind` on a relationship field will perform an `ALL` on the matched nodes to see if there is a match. This means you can only use `bind` to enforce a single relationship to a single node.

=== Field-level `bind`

You can use `bind` on a field, and the root is still considered the node itself. Taking the example at the start of this chapter, you could do the following to implement the same behaviour:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @auth(rules: [{ operations: [UPDATE], bind: { id: "$jwt.sub" } }])
    name: String!
}
----
