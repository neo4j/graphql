= Where

Use the `where` argument on types to conceptually append predicates to the Cypher `WHERE` clause. Given the current user ID is "123" and the following schema:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
}

extend type User @auth(rules: [{ where: { id: "$jwt.id" } }])
----

Then the user executes a GraphQL query for all users:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

Behind the scenes the userâ€™s ID is conceptually added to the query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { id: "123" }){
        id
        name
    }
}
----

Where is used on the following operations;

- `READ`
- `UPDATE`
- `CONNECT`
- `DISCONNECT`
- `DELETE`
