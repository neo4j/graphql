= `@auth` directive

The `@auth` directive definition is dynamically generated on runtime based on user type definitions.

== `rules`

You can have many rules for many operations. Each rule is fallen through until a match is found against the corresponding operation. If no match is found, an error is thrown. You can think of rules as a big `OR`.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
@auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE, UPDATE], ... }, ## or
    { operations: [READ, UPDATE], ...}, ## or
    { operations: [DELETE, UPDATE], ... } ## or
])
----

== `operations`

`operations` is an array which allows you to re-use the same rule for many operations.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
@auth(rules: [
    { operations: [CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, SUBSCRIBE] },
    { operations: [READ] }
])
----

NOTE: Note that the absence of an `operations` argument will imply _all_ operations.

Many different operations can be called at once, for example in the following Mutation:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createPosts(
        input: [
            {
                content: "I like GraphQL",
                creator: { connect: { where: { id: "user-01" } } }
            }
        ]
    ) {
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

In the above example, there is a `CREATE` operation followed by a `CONNECT`, so the auth rule must allow a user to perform both of these operations.

== Auth Value Plucking

When using the `@auth` directive, you use the following prefixes to substitute in their relevant values:

- `$jwt.` - pulls value from JWT
- `$context.` - pulls value from context
