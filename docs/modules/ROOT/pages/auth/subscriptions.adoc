xref::subscriptions/index.adoc[Subscriptions] can be used along with `@auth`, however, some operations are not supported. To setup rules,
use the `SUBSCRIBE` operation.

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String!
}

extend type Movie @auth(rules: [{ isAuthenticated: true, operations: [SUBSCRIBE] }])
```

== Authentication
If the authentication rules `isAuthenticated` and `allowUnauthenticated` are not met, the subscription request will fail and no events will
be sent.

== Roles
Roles can be set for subscriptions. Only requests matching the roles set will be accepted.

== Bind
NOTE: Not Supported

== Where

== Allow
