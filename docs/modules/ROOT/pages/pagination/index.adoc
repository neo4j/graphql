The Neo4j GraphQL Library offers two mechanisms for pagination:

- xref::pagination/offset-based.adoc#pagination-offset-based[Offset-based pagination] - Pagination based on offsets, often associated with navigation via pages.
- xref::pagination/cursor-based.adoc#pagination-cursor-based[Cursor-based pagination] - Pagination based on cursors, often associated with infinitely-scrolling applications.
