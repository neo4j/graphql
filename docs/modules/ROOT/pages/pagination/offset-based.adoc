= Offset-based pagination

Offset-based pagination, often associated with navigation via pages, can be achieved through the use of the `offset` and `limit` options available when querying for data.

Using the following type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    name: String!
}
----

You would fetch the first "page" of 10 by executing:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}
----

And then on subsequent calls, introduce the `offset` argument and increment it by 10 on each call.

*Page 2:*

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        offset: 10
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}
----

*Page 3:*

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(options: {
        offset: 20
        limit: 10
    }) {
        name
    }
}
----

And so on, so forth.

== Total number of pages

You can fetch the total number of records for a certain type using its count query, and then divide that number by your entries per page in order to calculate the total number of pages. This will allow to to determine what the last page is, and whether there is a next page.

See xref::queries.adoc[Count] queries for details on how to execute these queries.

== Paginating relationship fields

Say that in addition to the `User` type above, there is also a `Post` type which a `User` has many of. You can also fetch a `User` and then paginate through their posts:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: {
        name: "Billy"
    }) {
        name
        posts(options: {
            offset: 20
            limit: 10
        }) {
            content
        }
    }
}
