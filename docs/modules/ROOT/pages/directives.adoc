== `@auth`

The `@auth` directive is used to define complex fine-grained and role-based access control for object types and fields.

Reference: xref::auth/auth-directive.adoc#auth-directive[`@auth` directive]

== `@coalesce`

The `@coalesce` directive exposes a mechanism for querying against non-existent, `null` values on a node.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/default-values.adoc#type-definitions-default-values-coalesce[`@coalesce`]

== `@cypher`

The `@cypher` directive overrides field resolution (including `Query` and `Mutation` fields), instead resolving with the specified Cypher.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/cypher.adoc#type-definitions-cypher[`@cypher` directive]

== `@default`

The `@default` directive allows for the setting of a default value for a field on object creation.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/default-values.adoc#type-definitions-default-values-default[`@default`]

== `@exclude`

The `@exclude` directive is used on object types to instruct them to be skipped during Query and Mutation generation.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/access-control.adoc#type-definitions-access-control-exclude[`@exclude`]

== `@id`

The `@id` directive marks a field as the unique ID for an object type, and allows for autogeneration of IDs.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`]

== `@ignore`

The `@ignore` directive ignores a field, and it will need an alternative mechanism for resolution.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/access-control.adoc#type-definitions-access-control-ignore[`@ignore`]

== `@private`

The `@private` directive protects fields which should only be available through the xref::ogm/index.adoc[OGM].

Reference: xref::ogm/private.adoc#ogm-private[`@private` Directive]

== `@readonly`

The `@readonly` directive marks fields as read-only.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/access-control.adoc#type-definitions-access-control-readonly[`@readonly`]

== `@relationship`

The `@relationship` directive is used to configure relationships between object types.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/relationships.adoc#type-definitions-relationships[Relationships]

== `@timestamp`

The `@timestamp` directive flags fields to be used to store timestamps on create/update events.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-timestamp[`@timestamp`]

== `@writeonly`

The `@writeonly` directive marks fields as write-only.

Reference: xref::type-definitions/access-control.adoc#type-definitions-access-control-writeonly[`@writeonly`]
