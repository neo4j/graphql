= Filtering

== Operators

When querying for data, a number of operators are available for different types in the `where` argument of a Query or Mutation.

=== Equality operators

All types can be tested for either equality or non-equality. For the `Boolean` type, these are the only available comparison operators.

[[filtering-numerical-operators]]
=== Numerical operators

The following comparison operators are available for numeric types (`Int`, `Float`, xref::type-definitions/types.adoc#type-definitions-types-bigint[`BigInt`]), xref::type-definitions/types.adoc#type-definitions-types-temporal[Temporal Types] and xref::type-definitions/types.adoc#type-definitions-types-spatial[Spatial Types]:

* `_LT`
* `_LTE`
* `_GTE`
* `_GT`

Filtering of spatial types is different to filtering of numerical types and also offers an additional filter - see xref::type-definitions/types.adoc#type-definitions-types-spatial[Spatial Types].

=== String comparison

The following case-sensitive comparison operators are only available for use on `String` and `ID` types:

* `_STARTS_WITH`
* `_NOT_STARTS_WITH`
* `_ENDS_WITH`
* `_NOT_ENDS_WITH`
* `_CONTAINS`
* `_NOT_CONTAINS`

[[filtering-regex]]
==== RegEx matching

The filter `_MATCHES` is also available for comparison of `String` and `ID` types, which accepts a RegEx string as an argument and returns any matches.
Note that RegEx matching filters are **disabled by default**.

To enable the inclusion of this filter, set the config option `enableRegex` to `true`.

> The nature of RegEx matching means that on an unprotected API, this could potentially be used to execute a ReDoS attack (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) against the backing Neo4j database.

=== Array comparison

The following two comparison operators are available on non-array fields, and accept an array argument:

* `_IN`
* `_NOT_IN`

Conversely, the following operators are available on array fields, and accept a single argument:

* `_INCLUDES`
* `_NOT_INCLUDES`

These four operators are available for all types apart from `Boolean`.

== Usage

Using the type definitions from xref::queries.adoc[Queries], below are some example of how filtering can be applied when querying for data.

=== At the root of a Query

By using the `where` argument on the Query field in question, you can return a User with a particular ID:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { id: "7CF1D9D6-E527-4ACD-9C2A-207AE0F5CB8C" }) {
        name
    }
}
----

=== Filtering relationships

By using the `where` argument on a relationship field, you can filter for a Post with a particular ID across all Users:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
        posts(where: { id: "2D297425-9BCF-4986-817F-F06EE0A1D9C7" }) {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

== Aggregation Filtering

This library offers, for each relationship, an aggregation key inside the where argument. You can use the aggregation key to satisfy questions such as: 

* Find the posts where the number of likes are greater than 5
* Find flights where the average age of passengers is greater than or equal to 18
* Find movies where the shortest actor screen time is less than 10 minutes

You can use this where aggregation on both the `node` and `edge` of a relationship. 


=== Aggregation Filtering Usage Examples

==== Find the posts where the number of likes are greater than 5

Given the schema: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    name: String
}

type Post {
    content: String
    likes: [User] @relationship(type: "LIKES", direction: IN)
}
----

Answering the question: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { likesAggregate: { count_GT: 5 } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

==== Find flights where the average age of passengers is greater than or equal to 18

Given the schema: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Passenger {
    name: String
    age: Int
}

type Flight {
    code: String
    passengers: [Passenger] @relationship(type: "FLYING_ON", direction: IN)
}
----

Answering the question: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    flights(where: { passengersAggregate: { node: { age_AVERAGE_GTE: 18 } } }) {
        code
    }
}
----

==== Find movies where the shortest actor screen time is less than 10 minutes

Given the schema: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String
    actors: [Person] @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
}

type Person {
    name: String
}

interface ActedIn {
    screenTime: Int
}
----

Answering the question: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(where: { actorsAggregate: { edge: { screenTime_MIN_LT: 10 } } }) {
        title
    }
}
----

=== Aggregation Filtering Operators

Below you will learn more about the autogenerated filters available on the aggregate key and for each type on the `node` and `edge` of the specified relationship. 

==== Count
This is a special 'top level' key inside the where aggregation and will be available for all relationships. This is used to count the amount of relationships the parent node is connected to. 
The operators count has are as follows: 

* `count_EQUAL`
* `count_GT`
* `count_GTE`
* `count_LT`
* `count_LTE`

===== Example

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { likesAggregate: { count_GT: 5 } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

==== ID

You can only use the `_EQUAL` operator on types of `ID`. 

==== String

Fields of type String has the following operators: 

* `_EQUAL`
* `_GT`
* `_GTE`
* `_LT`
* `_LTE`
* `_AVERAGE_EQUAL`
* `_AVERAGE_GT`
* `_AVERAGE_GTE`
* `_AVERAGE_LT`
* `_AVERAGE_LTE`
* `_SHORTEST_EQUAL`
* `_SHORTEST_GT`
* `_SHORTEST_GTE`
* `_SHORTEST_LT`
* `_SHORTEST_LTE`
* `_LONGEST_EQUAL`
* `_LONGEST_GT`
* `_LONGEST_GTE`
* `_LONGEST_LT`
* `_LONGEST_LTE`

When using the operators you are 'asking questions' about the length of each String. 

===== Example

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { likesAggregate: { node: { name_LONGEST_GT: 5 } } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

* `_AVERAGE_LT`
* `_AVERAGE_LTE`
* `_MIN_EQUAL`
* `_MIN_GT`
* `_MIN_GTE`
* `_MIN_LT`
* `_MIN_LTE`
* `_MAX_EQUAL`
