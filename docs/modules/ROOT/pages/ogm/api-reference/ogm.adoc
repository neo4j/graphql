= `OGM`

== `constructor`

Returns an `OGM` instance.

Takes an `input` object as a parameter, which is then passed to the `Neo4jGraphQL` constructor. Supported options are listed in the documentation for xref::api-reference/neo4jgraphql.adoc[`Neo4jGraphQL`].

=== Example

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const ogm = new OGM({
    typeDefs,
});
----

== `model`

Returns a `Model` instance matching the passed in name, or throws an `Error` if one can't be found.

Accepts a single argument `name` of type `string`.

=== Example

For the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    username: String!
}
----

The following would successfully return a `Model` instance:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const User = ogm.model("User");
----

The following would throw an `Error`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const User = ogm.model("NotFound");
----
