= Installation

The OGM is very easy to install into a new or existing Node.js project. However it does have a couple of dependencies. The OGM depends on the Neo4j GraphQL Library, which will be installed when you install the OGM, so you will require the following dependencies:

- `@neo4j/graphql-ogm` is the OGM package.
- `graphql` is the package used by the Neo4j GraphQL Library to generate a schema and execute queries and mutations.
- `neo4j-driver` is the official Neo4j Driver package for JavaScript, necessary for interacting with the database.

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm install @neo4j/graphql-ogm graphql neo4j-driver
----

To use the OGM, it will need to be imported wherever you want to use it:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const { OGM } = require("@neo4j/graphql-ogm");
----

It's recommended to check out the xref::ogm/examples/index.adoc[Examples] to see where you might go from here.
