= Custom Directives

As of `@graphql-tools` version 8, the mechanism for defining and applying
custom directives has changed significantly, and this is reflected in the
Neo4j GraphQL Library.

It comes highly recommended to read and follow the
https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-directives[`@graphql-tools` documentation on schema directives]
for comprehensive documentation on this feature.

== Example

This example will work towards the implementation of a field directive to
uppercase field values, with the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
directive @uppercase on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

As per the `@graphql-tools` documentation, a function will be created which
returns both the definition and the transformer which provides the behaviour:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
function upperDirective(directiveName: string) {
    return {
        upperDirectiveTypeDefs: `directive @${directiveName} on FIELD_DEFINITION`,
        upperDirectiveTransformer: (schema: GraphQLSchema) =>
            mapSchema(schema, {
                [MapperKind.OBJECT_FIELD]: (fieldConfig) => {
                    const fieldDirective = getDirective(schema, fieldConfig, directiveName)?.[0];
                    if (fieldDirective) {
                        const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = fieldConfig;
                        fieldConfig.resolve = async (source, args, context, info) => {
                            const result = await resolve(source, args, context, info);
                            if (typeof result === "string") {
                                return result.toUpperCase();
                            }
                            return result;
                        };
                    }
                    return fieldConfig;
                },
            }),
    };
}
----

On calling the function, the type definition and the transformer will be
returned for the directive:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
const { upperDirectiveTypeDefs, upperDirectiveTransformer } = upperDirective("uppercase");
----

On construction of a `Neo4jGraphQL` instance, the directive definition can be
passed into the `typeDefs` array alongside the rest of the type definitions:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs: [
        upperDirectiveTypeDefs,
        `#graphql
            type Movie {
                name: String @uppercase
            }
        `,
    ],
    driver,
});
----

Finally, the Neo4j GraphQL schema must be transformed using the transformer
returned from the directive function:

[source, typescript, indent=0]
----
const schema = upperDirectiveTransformer(await neoSchema.getSchema());
----

This `schema` object is an instance of a `GraphQLSchema` which can be used in
any GraphQL tools, such as in Apollo Server.
