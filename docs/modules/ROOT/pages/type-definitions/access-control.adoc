= Access Control

This page addresses controlling schema generation output through the inclusion/exclusion of fields.

For fine-grained and role-based access control, see xref::auth/index.adoc[Auth].

[[type-definitions-access-control-exclude]]
== `@exclude`

This directive skips the generation of queries and/or particular/all mutations for the specified type.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum ExcludeOperation {
    CREATE
    READ
    UPDATE
    DELETE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to exclude the specified operations from query and mutation generation. If used without an argument, no queries or mutations will be generated for this type."""
directive @exclude(
    operations: [ExcludeOperation!]! = [CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE]
) on OBJECT
----

=== Usage

==== Disable Query field generation

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @exclude(operations: [READ]) {
    name: String
}
----

==== Disable single Mutation field generation

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @exclude(operations: [CREATE]) {
    name: String
}
----

==== Disable multiple Mutation field generation

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @exclude(operations: [CREATE, DELETE]) {
    name: String
}
----

==== Disable all Query and Mutation field generation

The following two type definitions are equivalent in the fact that no queries or mutations will be generated for either of them:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @exclude {
    name: String
}
----

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @exclude(operations: [CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE]) {
    name: String
}
----

[[type-definitions-access-control-ignore]]
== `@ignore`

This field will essentially be completely ignored during the generation of Query and Mutation fields, and will require another way to resolve the field, such as through the use of a custom resolver.

Any fields that the custom resolver depends on should be passed to the `dependsOn` argument to ensure that during the Cypher generation process those properties are selected from the database. Allowable fields are any returning a Scalar or Enum type including those defined using the xref::type-definitions/cypher.adoc#type-definitions-cypher[`@cypher`] directive.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to completely ignore a field definition, assuming that it will be fully accounted for by custom resolvers."""
directive @ignore(
    dependsOn: [String!]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

[[type-definitions-access-control-readonly]]
== `@readonly`

The field will only feature in mutations for creating, and object types for querying, and will not be mutable after creation. If `enableCreation: false` is specified, the field will also not be included in mutations for creating.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to only include a field in the object type within which the directive is applied. If used without an argument, the field will also be included in mutations for creating."""
directive @readonly(
    enableCreation: Boolean = true
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

[[type-definitions-access-control-writeonly]]
== `@writeonly`

This field will only feature in input types, and will not be available for querying the object type through a Query or through a Mutation response.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to only include a field in the generated input types for the object type within which the directive is applied, but exclude it from the object type itself."""
directive @writeonly on FIELD_DEFINITION
----
