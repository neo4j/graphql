[[type-definitions-autogeneration-id]]
== `@id`

This directive marks a field as the unique identifier for an object type, and by default; enables autogeneration of IDs for the field and implies that a unique node property constraint should exist for the property.

The format of each generated ID is a UUID generated by https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-randomuuid[randomUUID() function].

If autogeneration for an ID field is enabled, the field will not be present in input types for Mutations.

See xref::type-definitions/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#type-definitions-constraints-unique[Unique node property constraints] for details on how to assert the existence of the necessary database constraints for relevant fields.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Indicates that the field is an identifier for the object type. By default; autogenerated, and has a unique node property constraint in the database."""
directive @id(
    autogenerate: Boolean! = true
    unique: Boolean! = true
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

The following two type definitions are equivalent in that they both specify an ID which will benefit from autogeneration:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id
    username: String!
}
----

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id(autogenerate: true)
    username: String!
}
----

The following type definition is currently a no-op, as the `@id` directive only provides autogeneration as it stands:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id(autogenerate: false)
    username: String!
}
----

You can disable the mapping of the `@id` directive to a unique node property constraint by setting the `unique` argument to `false`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    id: ID! @id(unique: false)
    username: String!
}
----

[[type-definitions-autogeneration-timestamp]]
== `@timestamp`

=== Timestamps

This directive marks a field as a timestamp field, which will be used to store timestamps of when particular events happen through the GraphQL API.

> These events are triggered and stored at the GraphQL API layer. Events happening in your database through other routes will not trigger updates of these timestamps.

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum TimestampOperation {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate timestamps on particular events, which will be available as the value of the specified field."""
directive @timestamp(
    """Which events to generate timestamps on. Defaults to both create and update."""
    operations: [TimestampOperation!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

The following type definition has two individual fields to store the timestamps of create and update events.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    createdAt: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [CREATE])
    updatedAt: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [UPDATE])
}
----

The following two equivalent type definitions have a single field storing the event timestamp of the last create or update:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    lastModified: DateTime! @timestamp
}
----

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    lastModified: DateTime! @timestamp(operations: [CREATE, UPDATE])
}
----

[[type-definitions-autogeneration-callback]]
== `@callback`

The `@callback` directive is used to specify a function that will be invoked when updating or creating the properties on a node or relationship.

For non-required values, callbacks may return `undefined` (meaning that nothing will be changed or added to the property) or `null` (meaning that the property will be removed).

=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum CallbackOperation {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
}

"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to invoke the specified callback function when updating or creating the properties on a node or relationship."""
directive @callback(
    """Which events to invoke the callback on."""
    operations: [CallbackOperation!]! = [CREATE, UPDATE]
    """The name of the callback function."""
    name: String!
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

Type Definitions: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product {
    name: String!
    slug: @callback(operations: [CREATE, UPDATE], name: "slug")
}
----

Schema Construction: 

> Note that the callback is asynchronous!

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const slugCallback = async (root) => {
    return `${root.name}_slug`
}

new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    config: {
        callbacks: {
            slug: slugCallback
        }
    }
})
----
