== Unique node property constraints

Unique node property constraints map to `@unique` directives used in your type definitions, which has the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a uniqueness constraint in the database for the decorated field."""
directive @unique(
    """The name which should be used for this constraint. By default; type name, followed by an underscore, followed by the field name."""
    constraintName: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

Additionally, the usage of the xref::type-definitions/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`] directive by default implies that there should be a unique node property constraint in the database for that property.

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these constraints, and you will need to run a function on server startup. See the section xref::type-definitions/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#type-definitions-indexes-and-constraints-asserting[Asserting constraints] below for details.

=== `@unique` directive usage

`@unique` directives can only be used in GraphQL object types representing nodes, and will only be applied for the "main" label for the node. You can find some examples below.

In the following example, a unique constraint will be asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the next example, a unique constraint with name `unique_colour` will be asserted for the label `Colour` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique(constraintName: "unique_colour")
}
----

The `@node` directive is used to change the database label mapping in this next example, so a unique constraint will be asserted for the label `Color` and the property `hexadecimal`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(label: "Color") {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

In the following example, the `additionalLabels` argument of the `@node` directive is ignored when it comes to asserting constraints, so the outcome is the same as the example above:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Colour @node(label: "Color", additionalLabels: ["Hue"]) {
    hexadecimal: String! @unique
}
----

[[type-definitions-indexes-fulltext]]
== Fulltext indexes

You can use the `@fulltext` directive to add a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-full-text-search/[Full text index] inside Neo4j.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input FullTextInput {
  name: String!
  fields: [String]!
  defaultThreshold: Int
}

"""
Informs @neo4j/graphql that there should be a fulltext index in the database, allows users to search by the index in the generated schema.
"""
directive @fulltext(indexes: [FullTextInput]!) on OBJECT
----

Using this directive does not automatically ensure the existence of these indexes, and you will need to run a function on server startup. See the section xref::type-definitions/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#type-definitions-indexes-and-constraints-asserting[Asserting constraints] below for details.

=== Specifying the `@fulltext` directive

The directive can be used on nodes. Here we add a Fulltext index, called 'ProductName', for the name field, on the Product node.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ name: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
    name: String!
    color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
}
----

When you run xref::type-definitions/indexes-and-constraints.adoc#type-definitions-indexes-and-constraints-asserting[Asserting constraints] this shall do the index creation like so:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex("ProductName", ["Product"], ["name"])
----

=== Using the `@fulltext` directive

Once you specify the index, you will now gain a 'Top Level' `fulltext` key on the following operations:

1. read
2. count
3. aggregate

Here we use the `fulltext` key, and the phrase is using https://lucene.apache.org/[Luceneâ€™s full-text query language] to match and return Products:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    products(fulltext: { ProductName: { phrase: "beer OR cerveza" } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

You can also, optionally, specify the score for matching:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    products(fulltext: { ProductName: { phrase: "beer OR cerveza", score_EQUAL: 10 } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

> Note that you can only query one Fulltext index at once and that the fulltext key is only available on 'Top Level' queries.


[[type-definitions-indexes-and-constraints-asserting]]
== Asserting constraints

In order to ensure that the specified constraints exist in the database, you will need to run the function `assertIndexesAndConstraints`, the full details of which can be found in the xref::api-reference/neo4jgraphql.adoc#api-reference-assertconstraints[API reference]. A simple example to create the necessary constraints might look like the following, assuming a valid driver instance in the variable `driver`. This will create two constraints, one for each field decorated with `@id`,  `@unique` and apply the indexes specified in `@fulltext`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const typeDefs = gql`
    type Colour {
        id: ID! @id
        hexadecimal: String! @unique
    }

    type Product @fulltext(indexes: [{ name: "ProductName", fields: ["name"] }]) {
        name: String!
        color: Color! @relationship(type: "OF_COLOR", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

await neoSchema.assertIndexesAndConstraints({ options: { create: true }});
----
