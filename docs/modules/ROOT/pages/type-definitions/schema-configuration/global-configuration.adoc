= Global Configuration

Through the schema configuration, it is possible to globally disable specific types of operation.
To set up operations individually, refer to xref:type-definitions/schema-configuration/type-configuration.adoc[Type Configuration].
For instance, if you want to disable all top-level aggregation operations at once, Neo4j GraphQL Library offers this option through schema extensions with `@query`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie { 
    title: String 
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN) 
} 

type Actor { 
    name: String 
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT) 
}
extend schema @query(read: true, aggregate: false)
----

**Query**

    * `movies`
    * [.line-through]#`moviesAggregate`#
    * `moviesConnection`
    * `actors`
    * [.line-through]#`actorsAggregate`#
    * `actorsConnection`


**Invalid schema usage**

The same schema configuration directive cannot be applied to both Schema and Object.

Take the following type definitions as example:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie { 
    title: String 
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN) 
} 

type Actor @query(read: false, aggregate: true) { 
    name: String 
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT) 
}
extend schema @query(read: true, aggregate: false)
----

Such configuration will prompt the error `"@query directive already defined at the schema location"`.
