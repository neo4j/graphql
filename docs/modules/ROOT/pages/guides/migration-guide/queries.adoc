= Queries

Using `neo4j-graphql-js`, all of the arguments for a Query were root-level arguments. For example, for the following simple type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    averageRating: Float
}
----

The following Query would have been generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    Movie(title: String, averageRating: Float, first: Int, offset: Int, orderBy: [_MovieOrdering], filter: _MovieFilter): [Movie]
}
----

In `@neo4j/graphql`, the ethos has been to simplify the top-level arguments:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    movies(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions): [Movie]!
}
----

Changes to note for migration:

* Query fields were previously named in the singular, and in _PascalCase_ - they are now pluralized and in _camelCase_
* Query return types were previously in nullable lists of nullable types - they are now non-nullable lists of non-nullable types, _e.g._ `[Movie]` is now `[Movie!]!`; ensuring either an array of defined `Movie` objects or an empty array.
* In this example, the `_MovieFilter` type has essentially been renamed to `MovieWhere`, the `filter` arguments renamed to `where`, and the top-level field arguments `title` and `averageRating` removed - see xref::guides/migration-guide/queries.adoc#migration-guide-queries-filtering[Filtering (`where`)] below
* The `first`, `offset` and `orderBy` have been collapsed into the `MovieOptions` type and renamed `limit`, `offset` and `sort`, respectively - see xref::guides/migration-guide/queries.adoc#migration-guide-queries-options[Sorting and Pagination (`options`)] below

[[migration-guide-queries-filtering]]
== Filtering (`where`)

Simple equality fields are no longer available at the root of Query fields. As a simple demonstration, a simple query using `neo4j-graphql-js` that looked like:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    Movie(title: "Forrest Gump") {
        averageRating
    }
}
----

Is now changed to the following using `@neo4j/graphql`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(where: { title: "Forrest Gump" }) {
        averageRating
    }
}
----

When discussing how the field `where` of type `MovieWhere` differs to the field `filter` of `_MovieFilter` the following table can be used for guidance:

.Comparing the fields of the `_MovieFilter` and `MovieWhere` types
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|`neo4j-graphql-js` |`@neo4j/graphql`

|`AND: [_MovieFilter!]`
|`AND: [MovieWhere!]`

|`OR: [_MovieFilter!]`
|`OR: [MovieWhere!]`

|`NOT: _MovieFilter!`
|`NOT: MovieWhere!`

|`title: String`
|`title: String`

|`title_in: [String!]`
|`title_IN: [String!]`

|`title_contains: String`
|`title_CONTAINS: String`

|`title_starts_with: String`
|`title_STARTS_WITH: String`

|`title_ends_with: String`
|`title_ENDS_WITH: String`

|`title_regexp: String`
|`title_MATCHES: String`

|`averageRating: Float`
|`averageRating: Float`

|`averageRating_in: [Float!]`
|`averageRating_IN: [Float]`

|`averageRating_lt: Float`
|`averageRating_LT: Float`

|`averageRating_lte: Float`
|`averageRating_LTE: Float`

|`averageRating_gt: Float`
|`averageRating_GT: Float`

|`averageRating_gte: Float`
|`averageRating_GTE: Float`

For filtering on relationship fields, the `_some`, `_none`, `_single` and `_every` filters are not yet implemented.

[[migration-guide-queries-options]]
== Sorting and Pagination (`options`)

=== Sorting

Sorting has changed somewhat in `@neo4j/graphql`. For the example being used in this page, the `_MovieOrdering` type in `neo4j-graphql-js` was an enum which looked like the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum _MovieOrdering {
    title_asc
    title_desc
    averageRating_asc
    averageRating_desc
}
----

You could then query all movies ordered by title ascending by executing:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    Movie(orderBy: [title_asc]) {
        title
    }
}
----

In `@neo4j/graphql`, the sorting type `MovieSort` has become an input type with each field as an enum, like follows:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
enum SortDirection {
    ASC
    DESC
}

input MovieSort {
    title: SortDirection
    averageRating: SortDirection
}
----

To fetch all movies sorted by title ascending as per above, you would execute:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(options: { sort: [{ title: ASC }] }) {
        title
    }
}
----

=== Pagination

Pagination is broadly similar, with the arguments just renamed and moved a level deeper. For example, to return "page 3, with 10 results per page" using `neo4j-graphql-js` was:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    Movie(offset: 20, first: 10) {
        title
    }
}
----

Using `@neo4j/graphql`, this will now be:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(options: { offset: 20, limit: 10 }) {
        title
    }
}
----
