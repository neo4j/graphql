= Apollo Federation - beta

WARNING: Apollo Federation is currently experimental. There will be missing functionality, and breaking changes may occur in patch and minor releases. It is not recommended to use it in a production environment.

The Neo4j GraphQL Library can be used to generate a subgraph schema to be used as a part of a federated supergraph using https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-federation/[Apollo Federation].

== Usage

This section will walk through setting up some example subgraphs using the Neo4j GraphQL Library, and composing them into a supergraph schema.

=== Prerequisites

Install Rover from Apollo by following their https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started[installation instructions].

The example subgraphs below assume that the database URI is stored in an environment variable "NEO4J_URI", and the password in "NEO4J_PASSWORD".

Create a new directory, and within it, run the following commands to start a new npm project and install the dependencies:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm init --yes
npm install @apollo/server @neo4j/graphql graphql-tag neo4j-driver
----

=== Example subgraphs

NOTE: In the two subgraphs below, notice that `@shareable` has been applied to both of the `Location` definitions.
This is a necessary workaround because the Neo4j GraphQL Library generates identically named types for the `Location` definitions, which causes a collision when the Gateway stitches the two federated schemas.

==== Locations

Create a file `locations.js` with the following contents:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const { ApolloServer } = require("@apollo/server");
const { startStandaloneServer } = require("@apollo/server/standalone");
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const gql = require("graphql-tag");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const typeDefs = gql`
  extend schema
    @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
          import: ["@key", "@shareable"])

  type Location @key(fields: "id") @shareable {
    id: ID!
    "The name of the location"
    name: String!
    "A short description about the location"
    description: String!
    "The location's main photo as a URL"
    photo: String!
  }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
  process.env.NEO4J_URI,
  neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", process.env.NEO4J_PASSWORD)
);

const neo4jgraphql = new Neo4jGraphQL({
  typeDefs,
  driver,
});

neo4jgraphql.getSubgraphSchema().then((schema) => {
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });

  startStandaloneServer(server, { listen: { port: 4001 } }).then((url) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
  });
});
----

Start this server by running `node locations.js`.

==== Reviews

Create a file `reviews.js` with the following contents:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const { ApolloServer } = require("@apollo/server");
const { startStandaloneServer } = require("@apollo/server/standalone");
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const gql = require("graphql-tag");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const typeDefs = gql`
  extend schema
    @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
          import: ["@key", "@shareable"])

  type Location @key(fields: "id") @shareable {
    id: ID!
    "The calculated overall rating based on all reviews"
    overallRating: Float
    "All submitted reviews about this location"
    reviewsForLocation: [Review]!
  }

  type Review {
    id: ID!
    "Written text"
    comment: String
    "A number from 1 - 5 with 1 being lowest and 5 being highest"
    rating: Int
    "The location the review is about"
    location: Location! @relationship(type: "HAS_REVIEW", direction: IN)
  }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
  process.env.NEO4J_URI,
  neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", process.env.NEO4J_PASSWORD)
);

const neo4jgraphql = new Neo4jGraphQL({
  typeDefs,
  driver,
});

neo4jgraphql.getSubgraphSchema().then((schema) => {
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });

  startStandaloneServer(server, { listen: { port: 4002 } }).then((url) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
  });
});
----

Start this server by running `node reviews.js`.

=== Supergraph composition

Create a new file, `supergraph.yaml`

[source, yaml, indent=0]
----
federation_version: 2
subgraphs:
  locations:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4001/
  reviews:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4002/
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4002/
----

In the same directory, execute the following command to generate the supergraph schema:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
rover supergraph compose --config supergraph.yaml > supergraph.graphql
----

Finally, execute the following commands to download Apollo Router and start the supergraph server:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
./router --dev --supergraph supergraph.graphql
----

You should now be able to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in a web browser to access Apollo Sandbox and query the supergraph.
