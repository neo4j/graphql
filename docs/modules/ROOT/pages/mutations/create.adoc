[[mutations-create]]
= Create

Using the following type definitions for these examples:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following create Mutations and response types will be generated for the above type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type CreatePostsMutationResponse {
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type CreateUsersMutationResponse {
    users: [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
    createPosts(input: [PostCreateInput!]!): CreatePostsMutationResponse!
    createUsers(input: [UsersCreateInput!]!): CreateUsersMutationResponse!
}
----

The `CreateInput` types closely mirror the object type definitions, allowing you to create not only the type in question, but to recurse down and perform further operations on related types in the same Mutation.

> The `id` field will be absent from both create input types as the xref::reference/directives/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`] directive has been used.

== Single create

A single user can be created by executing the following GraphQL statement:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createUsers(input: [
        {
            name: "John Doe"
        }
    ]) {
        users {
            id
            name
        }
    }
}
----

This will create a User with name "John Doe", and that name plus the autogenerated ID will be returned.

== Nested create

A User and an initial Post can be created by executing the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    createUsers(input: [
        {
            name: "John Doe"
            posts: {
                create: [
                    {
                        node: {
                            content: "Hi, my name is John!"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]) {
        users {
            id
            name
            posts {
                id
                content
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This will create a User with name "John Doe", an introductory Post, both of which will be returned with their autogenerated IDs.

== `connectOrCreate` relationships
If a related node has a `@unique` or `@id` directive defined, `connectOrCreate` can be used in a nested create to perform a `MERGE` operation on the related node, creating a new relationship and the related node if it doesn't exist.

Consider the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
    name: String!
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}

type Movie {
    title: String
    id: ID! @id
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}
----

Because a movie ID is unique, `connectOrCreate` can be used in an Actor mutation to ensure a movie exists before connecting. Note that only `@unique` or `@id` fields can be used in `where`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  createActors(input: {
    name: "Tom Hanks",
    movies: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: { node: { id: "1234" } }
        onCreate: { node: { title: "Forrest Gump" } }
      }
    }
  }) {
    info {
      nodesCreated
    }
  }
}
----

This will ensure that a movie with ID 1234 exists and it is connected to `"Tom Hanks"`. If the movie does not exist, it will be created with the title `"Forrest Gump"`. Note that if the movie with the given ID already exists, it will be connected to it, regardless of the title.

[[optimizing-create-operations]]
== Optimizing create operations

It's possible to use the Neo4jGraphQL library to create several nodes and relationships in a single mutation, however,
it's well known that performance issues are present in performing this task.
A solution has been implemented that doesn't require any changes from the user.
However, there are still several situations where this kind of optimization is not achievable.

=== Subscriptions enabled

No optimizations are available if a Subscription plugin it's being used.

=== `@populated_by`

No optimizations are available if a Node affected by the mutation has a field with the directive `@populated_by`.

=== `connect` and `connectOrCreate` operations

No optimizations are available if the GraphQL input contains the `connect` or `connectOrCreate` operation.
