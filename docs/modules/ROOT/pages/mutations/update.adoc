= Update

Using the following type definitions for these examples:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following update Mutations and response types will be generated for the above type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type UpdatePostsMutationResponse {
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type UpdateUsersMutationResponse {
    users: [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
    updatePosts(
        where: PostWhere
        update: PostUpdateInput
        connect: PostConnectInput
        disconnect: PostDisconnectInput
        create: PostCreateInput
        delete: PostDeleteInput
    ): UpdatePostsMutationResponse!
    updateUsers(
        where: UserWhere
        update: UserUpdateInput
        connect: UserConnectInput
        disconnect: UserDisconnectInput
        create: UserCreateInput
        delete: UserDeleteInput
    ): UpdateUsersMutationResponse!
}
----

> The `id` field not be update-able as the xref::type-definitions/autogeneration.adoc#type-definitions-autogeneration-id[`@id`] directive has been used.

== Single update

Say you wanted to edit the content of a Post:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    updatePosts(
        where: {
            id: "892CC104-A228-4BB3-8640-6ADC9F2C2A5F"
        }
        update: {
            content: "Some new content for this Post!"
        }
    ) {
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

== Nested create

Instead of creating a Post and connecting it to a User, you could update a User and create a Post as part of the Mutation:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    updateUsers(
        where: { name: "John Doe" }
        create: {
            posts: [
                { node: { content: "An interesting way of adding a new Post!" } }
            ]
        }
    ) {
        users {
            id
            name
            posts {
                content
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== `connectOrCreate` relations
If a related node has a `@unique` or `@id` directive defined, `connectOrCreate` can be used in a nested update to perform a `MERGE` operation on the related node, creating a new relation and the related node if it doesn't exists.

Consider the following type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Actor {
    name: String!
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}

type Movie {
    title: String
    id: ID! @id
    actors: [Actor]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}
----

Because a movie id is unique, `connectOrCreate` can be used in an Actor mutation to ensure a movie exists before connecting, note that only `@unique` parameters can be used in `where`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation Mutation {
  updateActors(
    update: {
        movies: {
          connectOrCreate: {
            where: {node: {id: "1234"}}
            onCreate: {node: {title: "Forrest Gump"}}
          }
        }
    },
    where: { name: "Tom Hanks"}
  ) {
    info {
      nodesCreated
    }
  }
}
----

In this case, all actors matching _"Tom Hanks"_ will be connected to the Movie with id _"1234"_. If the movie with given id does not exists, it will be created with the title _"Forrest Gump"_.

For update operations, `connectOrCreate` can also be used as a top-level input:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation Mutation {
  updateActors(
      connectOrCreate: {
        movies: {
            where: {node: {id: "1234"}}
            onCreate: {node: {title: "Forrest Gump"}}
        }
      },
      where: { name: "Tom Hanks"}
  ) {
    info {
      nodesCreated
    }
  }
}
----

This operation is equivalent to the previous example.
