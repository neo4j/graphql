== Preventing overfetching

When querying for unions and interfaces in Cypher, each union member/interface implementation is broken out into a subquery and joined with `UNION`. For example, using one of the examples above, when we query with no `where` argument, each subquery has a similar structure:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CALL {
    WITH this
    OPTIONAL MATCH (this)-[has_content:HAS_CONTENT]->(blog:Blog)
    RETURN { __resolveType: "Blog", title: blog.title }
UNION
    WITH this
    OPTIONAL MATCH (this)-[has_content:HAS_CONTENT]->(journal:Post)
    RETURN { __resolveType: "Post" }
}
----

Now if you were to leave both subqueries and add a `WHERE` clause for blogs, it would look like this:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CALL {
    WITH this
    OPTIONAL MATCH (this)-[has_content:HAS_CONTENT]->(blog:Blog)
    WHERE blog.title IS NOT NULL
    RETURN { __resolveType: "Blog", title: blog.title }
UNION
    WITH this
    OPTIONAL MATCH (this)-[has_content:HAS_CONTENT]->(journal:Post)
    RETURN { __resolveType: "Post" }
}
----

As you can see, the subqueries are now "unbalanced", which could result in massive overfetching of `Post` nodes.

So, when a `where` argument is passed in, only union members which are in the `where` object are fetched, so it is essentially acting as a logical OR gate, different from the rest of the `where` arguments in the schema:

[source, cypher, indent=0]
----
CALL {
    WITH this
    OPTIONAL MATCH (this)-[has_content:HAS_CONTENT]->(blog:Blog)
    WHERE blog.title IS NOT NULL
    RETURN { __resolveType: "Blog", title: blog.title }
}
----
