= Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions add real-time capabilities to your API. 
Subscriptions allow to listen for changes on the database and they are available when using `@neo4j/graphql`.

All xref:subscriptions/events.adoc[events] will be triggered individually, even in events caused by the same Mutation. 
Events are fired on the creation or deletion of nodes and relationships, and on the update of nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Only changes made through `@neo4j/graphql` will trigger events. Changes made directly to the database or using the xref::reference/directives/cypher.adoc[`@cypher` directive] will **not** trigger any event.

== Subscriptions with Auth
Some `auth` clauses can be used with subscriptions. How these work is documented xref::auth/auth-directive-subs.adoc#subscriptions[here].
