= Subscriptions (Beta)

WARNING: Subscriptions are only available as a beta; its API may change in the future. It is not recommended to use subscriptions in production environments.

GraphQL subscriptions add real-time capabilities to your API. Subscriptions allow to listen for changes on the database.

The following subscriptions are available when using `@neo4j/graphql`:

* **xref::subscriptions/events/create.adoc[Create]** - Listen for newly created nodes.
* **xref::subscriptions/events/update.adoc[Update]** - Listen for changes to existing nodes.
* **xref::subscriptions/events/delete.adoc[Delete]** - Listen for deleted nodes.

All events will be triggered individually, with one event per node created, updated or deleted, even in events caused by the same mutation.

NOTE: Only changes made through `@neo4j/graphql` will trigger events. Changes made directly to the database or using the xref::type-definitions/cypher.adoc[`@cypher` directive]
will **not** trigger any event.

== Subscriptions with Auth
Some `auth` clauses can be used with subscriptions. How these work is documented xref::auth/subscriptions.adoc[here].
