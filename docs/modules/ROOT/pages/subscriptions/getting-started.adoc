= Getting Started with Subscriptions

WARNING: Subscriptions are only available as a beta; its API may change in the future. It is not recommended to use subscriptions in production environments.

To get started with subscriptions you need a GraphQL server with subscription capabilities.

== Example using Apollo and WebSockets
For this example, we will use link:https://www.apollographql.com/[Apollo] and link:https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws].

=== Setting up the server

Install the following dependencies:
```bash
npm i --save ws graphql-ws neo4j-driver @neo4j/graphql express apollo-server-express apollo-server-core
```

The following code implements a simple `apollo-server-express` server with subscriptions. You can find more examples and documentation
on subscriptions in link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/[Apollo's documentation].
```javascript
const { createServer } = require("http");
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver');
const { Neo4jGraphQL, Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsSingleInstancePlugin } = require('@neo4j/graphql');
const { WebSocketServer } = require("ws");
const { useServer } = require("graphql-ws/lib/use/ws");
const express = require('express');
const  { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server-express");
const { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } = require("apollo-server-core");

const typeDefs = `
    type Movie {
        title: String
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password"));

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    plugins: {
        subscriptions: new Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsSingleInstancePlugin(),
    },
});

async function main() {
    // apollo-server-express server setup with WebSockets
    const app = express();
    const httpServer = createServer(app);
    const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
        server: httpServer,
        path: "/graphql",
    });

    // Neo4j schema
    const schema = await neoSchema.getSchema();
    const serverCleanup = useServer({
        schema
    }, wsServer);

    const server = new ApolloServer({
        schema,
        plugins: [
            ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({
                httpServer
            }),
            {
                async serverWillStart() {
                    return {
                        async drainServer() {
                            await serverCleanup.dispose();
                        },
                    };
                },
            },
        ],
    });
    await server.start();
    server.applyMiddleware({
        app
    });

    const PORT = 4000;
    httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}/grahpql`);
    });
}

main();
```

NOTE: The example above uses the **xref::subscriptions/plugins/single-instance.adoc[single instance plugin]** and cannot scale horizontally.

=== GraphQL subscriptions
With the previous server running, we have subscriptions available for `Movie` and `Actor`. We can subscribe to new movies created with the following statement:
```graphql
subscription {
    movieCreated(where: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        createdMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

Any new movie created with the matching title will trigger a subscription. You can try this with the following query:
```graphql
mutation {
    createMovies(input: [{ title: "The Matrix" }]) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: This example uses the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] implementation, if you are using Apollo Studio, make sure
to select "graphql-ws" implementation in connection settings.
