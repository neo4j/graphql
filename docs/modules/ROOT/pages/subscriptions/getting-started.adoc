= Getting Started with Subscriptions

To get started with subscriptions you need a GraphQL server with subscription capabilities. 
You can enable them by passing the `subscriptions` feature to `Neo4jGraphQL`:

```javascript
new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        subscriptions: true
    },
});
```

== Example using Apollo and WebSockets
For this example, we will use link:https://www.apollographql.com/[Apollo] and link:https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws].

=== Setting up the server

Install the following dependencies:
```bash
npm i --save ws graphql-ws neo4j-driver @neo4j/graphql express @apollo/server body-parser cors
```

The following code implements a simple `@apollo/server` server with subscriptions. You can find more examples and documentation
on subscriptions in link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/[Apollo's documentation].
```javascript
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { expressMiddleware } from "@apollo/server/express4";
import { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } from "@apollo/server/plugin/drainHttpServer";
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cors from "cors";
import { createServer } from "http";
import neo4j from 'neo4j-driver';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from '@neo4j/graphql';
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";
import { useServer } from "graphql-ws/lib/use/ws";
import express from 'express';

const typeDefs = `
    type Movie {
        title: String
    }

    type Actor {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password"));

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        subscriptions: true
    },
});

async function main() {
    // Apollo server setup with WebSockets
    const app = express();
    const httpServer = createServer(app);
    const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
        server: httpServer,
        path: "/graphql",
    });

    // Neo4j schema
    const schema = await neoSchema.getSchema();

    const serverCleanup = useServer(
        {
            schema,
            context: (ctx) => {
                return ctx;
            },
        },
        wsServer
    );

    const server = new ApolloServer({
        schema,
        plugins: [
            ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({
                httpServer
            }),
            {
                async serverWillStart() {
                    return Promise.resolve({
                        async drainServer() {
                            await serverCleanup.dispose();
                        },
                    });
                },
            },
        ],
    });
    await server.start();

    app.use(
        "/graphql",
        cors(),
        bodyParser.json(),
        expressMiddleware(server, {
            context: async ({ req }) => ({ req }),
        })
    );

    const PORT = 4000;
    httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}/grahpql`);
    });
}

main();
```

[NOTE]
====
This setup will use the default subscriptions mechanism suitable only for development, testing and single instance servers. 
If you need to scale horizontally for a production-ready application, see xref::subscriptions/scaling.adoc[Horizontal scaling].
====

=== GraphQL subscriptions
With the previous server running, we have subscriptions available for `Movie` and `Actor`. We can subscribe to new movies created with the following statement:
```graphql
subscription {
    movieCreated(where: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        createdMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

Any new movie created with the matching title will trigger a subscription. You can try this with the following query:
```graphql
mutation {
    createMovies(input: [{ title: "The Matrix" }]) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: This example uses the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] implementation, if you are using Apollo Studio, make sure
to select "graphql-ws" implementation in connection settings.
