= Single Instance Plugin

The `@neo4j/graphql` library provides a zero-dependency plugin to be used during development to quickly deploy a subscriptions server locally in a single instance.
If can be imported directly:

```javascript
const { Neo4jGraphQL, Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsSingleInstancePlugin } = require('@neo4j/graphql');

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    plugins: {
        subscriptions: new Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsSingleInstancePlugin(),
    },
});
```

For a full example, check the xref::subscriptions/getting-started.adoc[Getting started] guide.

WARNING: This plugin is not recommended for production environments unless running a single instance.
