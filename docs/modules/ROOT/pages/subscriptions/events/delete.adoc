[[delete]]
= Delete Subscriptions

Subscriptions to `DELETE` events will trigger on deleted nodes.

NOTE: Only deleted nodes will trigger this event, deleted relationships will **not** trigger any event.

== `DELETE` event
A subscription to a type can be made with the top-level subscription `[type]Deleted`. The subscription will contain the following fields:

* `event`: The event triggering this subscription, in this case it will always be `"DELETE"`.
* `deleted<typename>`: The top-level properties of the deleted node, these will be the properties right before the node was deleted. Relationships are not available.
* `timestamp`: The timestamp in which the mutation was made. Note that multiple events may come with the same timestamp if triggered by the same query.

=== Example
Considering the following type definitions:
```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String
    genre: String
}
```

A subscription to any deleted `Movie` would look like:
```graphql
subscription {
    movieDeleted {
        deletedMovie {
            title
        }
        event
        timestamp
    }
}
```
