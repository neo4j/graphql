This chapter contains commonly asked questions and their solutions.

== I've upgraded from <1.1.0 and my `DateTime` fields aren't sorting as expected

Due to a bug in versions less than 1.1.0, there is a chance that your `DateTime` fields are stored in the database as strings instead of temporal values. You should perform a rewrite of those properties in your database using a Cypher query. For an example where the affected node has label "Movie" and the affected property is "timestamp", you can do this using the following Cypher:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE apoc.meta.type(m.timestamp) = "STRING"
SET m.timestamp = datetime(m.timestamp)
RETURN m
----

== I've created some data and then gone to query it, but it's not there

If you use a causal cluster or an Aura Professional instance, there is a chance that the created data is not yet present on the server which gets connected to on the next GraphQL query.

You can ensure that the data is available to query by passing a bookmark into your request - see xref::driver-configuration.adoc[Specifying Neo4j Bookmarks] for more information.

== What is `_emptyInput` in my update and create inputs?

`_emptyInput` will appear in your update and create inputs if you define a type with only auto-generated and/or relationship properties. It is a placeholder property and therefore giving it a value in neither update nor create will give it a value on the node. `_emptyInput` will be removed if you add a user-provided property.

The following example will create inputs with `_emptyInput`:

```graphql
type Cookie {
    id: ID! @id
    owner: Owner!  @relationship(type: "HAS_OWNER", direction: OUT)
    # f: String # If you don't want _emptyInput, uncomment this line.
}
```

== Relationship nullability isn't being enforced in my graph

Currently, and given the typeDefs below, Neo4j GraphQL will enforce cardinality when creating and updating a one-one relationship such as the movie director field below: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    director: Person! @relationship(type: "DIRECTED", direction: IN)
    actors: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Person {
    name: String!
}
----

However, at this point, there is no mechanism to support validating the actors relationship. Furthermore, there is a known limitation given if you were create a movie and a director in one mutation: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  createMovies(
    input: [
      {
        title: "Forrest Gump"
        director: { create: { node: { name: "Robert Zemeckis" } } }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    movies {
      title
      director {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Then delete the director node: 

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  deletePeople(where: { name: "Robert Zemeckis" }) {
    nodesDeleted
  }
}
----

No error is thrown, even though the schema states that all movies must have a director thus technically rendering the movie node invalid. 

Finally, we do not enforce relationship cardinality on union or interface relationships.
