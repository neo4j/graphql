= Optimizing create operations

It's possible to use the Neo4jGraphQL library to create several nodes and relationships in a single mutation, however,
it's well known that performance issues are present in performing this task.
A solution has been implemented that doesn't require any changes from the user.
However, there are still several situations where this kind of optimization is not achievable.

== Subscriptions enabled

No optimizations are available if a Subscription plugin it's being used.

== `@populated_by`

No optimizations are available if a Node affected by the mutation has a field with the directive `@populated_by`.

== `connect` and `connectOrCreate` operations

No optimizations are available if the GraphQL input contains the `connect` or `connectOrCreate` operation.
