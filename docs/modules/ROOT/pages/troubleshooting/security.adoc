== Authorization not triggered for empty match

If a query yields no results, the xref::auth/auth-directive.adoc[Authorization] process will not be triggered.
This means that the result will be empty, instead of throwing an authentication error. Unauthorized users may
then discern whether or not a certain type exists in the database, even if data itself cannot be accessed.
