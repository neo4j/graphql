[[queries]]
= Queries

Each node defined in type definitions will have two Query fields generated for it:

1. One for querying data
2. One for aggregating data

The examples in this chapter will use the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN, properties: "PostedAt")
    createdAt: DateTime!
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String!
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT, properties: "PostedAt")
    friends: [User!]! @relationship(type: "FRIENDS_WITH", direction: OUT)
}

interface PostedAt @relationshipProperties {
    date: DateTime
}
----

For which the following Query fields will be generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    posts(where: PostWhere, options: PostOptions): [Post!]!
    postsAggregate(where: PostWhere): PostAggregationSelection!

    users(where: UserWhere, options: UserOptions): [User!]!
    usersAggregate(where: UserWhere): UserAggregationSelection!
}
----

== Query

Each field for querying data accepts two arguments:

- `where` - used for xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc[Filtering] data
- `options` - used to specify xref::queries-aggregations/sorting.adoc[Sorting] and xref::pagination/index.adoc[Pagination] options

=== Querying for all User nodes

The following Query will return all User nodes, returning their ID and name.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

=== Query for user with name "Jane Smith" and their posts

The following Query will return all Users, returning the content which they have posted.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { name: "Jane Smith" }) {
        id
        name
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

=== Undirected Queries

All xref:reference/type-definitions/relationships.adoc[relationships] are created with a _direction_ from one **node** to another.
By default, all queries follow the direction defined in the relationship, however, in some cases we may need to query for
all related nodes, regardless of the direction of the relationship. This can be achieved with the argument `directed: false`.

For example, the following query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        friends: friends(directed: false) {
            name
        }
    }
}
----

Will return all user friends, regardless on the direction of the relationship `"FRIENDS_WITH"`.

Undirected relationships can also be used in the same fashion with connections:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query Query {
  users {
    friendsConnection(directed: false) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Note that _undirected relationships_ are only supported in queries.

The xref:reference/type-definitions/relationships.adoc#_querydirection[type definitions] for a relationship may define
a different behaviour, so the `directed` option may not be available in some cases.

[[queries-aggregate]]
== Aggregate

Neo4j GraphQL supports aggregations on fields with type:

1. `ID`- String
2. `String` - String
3. `Int` - Numerical
4. `Float` - Numerical
5. `BigInt` - Numerical
6. `DateTime`
7. `Time`
8. `LocalTime`
9. `LocalDateTime`
10. `Duration`

Numerical Fields will expose the following aggregation selections:

1. `min`
2. `max`
3. `average`
4. `sum`

String fields will expose:

1. `shortest`
2. `longest`

The rest will only expose:

1. `min`
2. `max`


Aggregation queries accepts a `where` argument for xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc[filtering] data.

=== Counting Using aggregation

The following Query will count all User nodes:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        count
    }
}
----

=== Counting User nodes where name starts with "J"

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate(where: { name_STARTS_WITH: "J" }) {
        count
    }
}
----

=== Querying for the longest User name

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        name {
            longest
        }
    }
}
----

=== Querying for first Post date

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    postsAggregate {
        createdAt {
            min
        }
    }
}
----

[[queries-aggregate-related-nodes]]
== Aggregate related nodes

Related nodes can also be aggregated within a query by accessing the aggregation fields in the node.
In these fields, you can **count**, aggregate the **nodes** or **edges** fields.

The same selections and types as before are available in relationship aggregations.

=== Counting all posts per users

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate {
            count
        }
    }
}
----

=== Finding longest post per user
By using the `node` field, related nodes properties can be aggregated.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            node {
                content {
                  longest
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Aggregate relationships
Relationship properties can be aggregated as well by using the `edge` field.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            edge {
              date {
                max
              }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Undirected aggregation queries

When performing an aggregation on related nodes, the query against the relationship
can be defined as an xref::queries-aggregations/queries.adoc#_undirected_queries[undirected] using the argument `directed: false`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate(directed: false) {
            count
        }
    }
}
----
