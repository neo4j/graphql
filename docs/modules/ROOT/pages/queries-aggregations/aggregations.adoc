[[queries-aggregations]]
= Aggregations

Neo4j GraphQL supports aggregations on fields with type:

1. `ID`- String
2. `String` - String
3. `Int` - Numerical
4. `Float` - Numerical
5. `BigInt` - Numerical
6. `DateTime`
7. `Time`
8. `LocalTime`
9. `LocalDateTime`
10. `Duration`

Numerical Fields will expose the following aggregation selections:

1. `min`
2. `max`
3. `average`
4. `sum`

String fields will expose:

1. `shortest`
2. `longest`

The rest will only expose:

1. `min`
2. `max`


Aggregation queries accepts a `where` argument for xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc[filtering] data.

== Counting Using aggregation

The following Query will count all User nodes:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        count
    }
}
----

== Counting User nodes where name starts with "J"

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate(where: { name_STARTS_WITH: "J" }) {
        count
    }
}
----

== Querying for the longest User name

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        name {
            longest
        }
    }
}
----

== Querying for first Post date

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    postsAggregate {
        createdAt {
            min
        }
    }
}
----

[[queries-aggregate-related-nodes]]
== Aggregate related nodes

Related nodes can also be aggregated within a query by accessing the aggregation fields in the node.
In these fields, you can **count**, aggregate the **nodes** or **edges** fields.

The same selections and types as before are available in relationship aggregations.

=== Counting all posts per users

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate {
            count
        }
    }
}
----

=== Finding longest post per user
By using the `node` field, related nodes properties can be aggregated.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            node {
                content {
                  longest
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Aggregate relationships
Relationship properties can be aggregated as well by using the `edge` field.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        postsAggregate {
            edge {
              date {
                max
              }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Undirected aggregation queries

When performing an aggregation on related nodes, the query against the relationship
can be defined as an xref::queries-aggregations/queries.adoc#_undirected_queries[undirected] using the argument `directed: false`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        postsAggregate(directed: false) {
            count
        }
    }
}
----
