= Introspect schema from an existing Neo4j database

Neo4j provides a tool that enables you, with very little effort, to generate GraphQL type definitions from an existing database. This is provided by a separate npm package, `@neo4j/introspector`.

This is usually a one-time-thing and should be considered a starting point for a GraphQL schema.

== Features

This tool has full support for generating type definitions, including:

- `@relationship` directive, including relationship properties
- `@node`
    - `label` for mapping where a node label might use a character that's not in the GraphQL supported character set
    - `additionalLabels` for nodes that has multiple labels
- Generating a read-only version of the GraphQL type definitions, i.e. generate a `@exclude(operations: [CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE])` directive on all node types.

== Limitations

If an element property has mixed types through out your graph, that property will be excluded from the
generated type definitions. The reason for this is that your GraphQL server will throw an error if it
finds data that doesn't match the specified type.

If any properties are skipped, there will be output in the xref::troubleshooting/index.adoc[Debug Logging].

== Usage examples

Currently there's a programmatic API for introspecting the Neo4j schema and generating GraphQL type definitions.

=== Introspect and persist to file

This example introspects the database schema, generates GraphQL type definitions and persists them to a file `schema.graphql`.

You can then serve this file with your GraphQL server.

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { toGraphQLTypeDefs } from "@neo4j/introspector";
import fs from "fs";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const sessionFactory = () => driver.session({ defaultAccessMode: neo4j.session.READ })

// We create a async function here until "top level await" has landed
// so we can use async/await
async function main() {
    const typeDefs = await toGraphQLTypeDefs(sessionFactory)
    fs.writeFileSync('schema.graphql', typeDefs)
    await driver.close();
}
main()

=== Introspect and spin up a read-only schema

This example generates a **read-only** version of the schema from the database and immediately spins up an Apollo server.

Here the type definitions are never persisted to disk.

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import { toGraphQLTypeDefs } from "@neo4j/introspector";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password")
);

const sessionFactory = () =>
    driver.session({ defaultAccessMode: neo4j.session.READ });

// We create a async function here until "top level await" has landed
// so we can use async/await
async function main() {
    const readonly = true; // We don't want to expose mutations in this case
    const typeDefs = await toGraphQLTypeDefs(sessionFactory, readonly);

    const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

    const server = new ApolloServer({
        schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
    });

    await startStandaloneServer(server, {
        context: async ({ req }) => ({ req }),
    });
}

main();
