[[v3-migration]]
= 3.0.0 Migration
This document lists all breaking changes from version 2.x.y to 3.0.0 and how to update.

== How to upgrade
Simply update `@neo4j/graphql` using npm or your package manager of choice:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
npm update @neo4j/graphql
----

== Asynchronous schema generation
Schema generation is now asynchronous. Instead of using the property `schema`, now the method `getSchema` will return the schema
as a `Promise`. This means that creating a server now requires awaiting for that method:

Instead of
[source, JavaScript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: neoSchema.schema,
});
----

Now you'll need to do the following:

[source, JavaScript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
neoSchema.getSchema().then((schema) => {
    const server = new ApolloServer({
        schema: schema
    });
});
----

== Relationship changes
This release contains an overhaul of our relationship validations, which will require a few changes to the schema.

=== Many-to-* relationships
To improve consistency and validation, **all** "many-to-*" relationships need to be defined as _required_ in the schema:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    director: Director @relationship(type: "DIRECTED", direction: IN)
}
----

Note that any other notation, such as `[Actor]` or `[Actor!]` will **not** be valid. "One-to-one" relationships
such as `Director` remain unchanged.

=== Relationship cardinality
Runtime checks for "one-to*" relationships have been added in this release, ensuring that the correct number of relationships exist. This means that some
databases with inconsistent relationships between the schema definition and the actual data may now fail in some queries.
This may have happened due to different reasons such as direct changes in the database or changes to the type definitions.
Previous versions of `@neo4j/graphql` did not have any consistency check, so normal use of these versions may have lead to
inconsistent relationships.

For these cases, please ensure that the database is following your schema definition or update the schema to reflect the
actual existing relationships, taking care of which relationships are 1-to-* or many-to-many.

== Count query no longer supported
Queries using `count` at the root level are no longer supported. For example:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersCount
}
----

The same operation, can now be achieved with a xref::queries-aggregations/queries.adoc#_counting_using_aggregation[count aggregation] query:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    usersAggregate {
        count
    }
}
----

=== Relationship filters
`where` filters for relationship queries now explicitly state `ALL`, `NONE`, `SINGLE`, and `SOME` as part of filter name.

Queries using old relationship filters, will now need to use `\{relationship\}_SOME`. For example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  movies(where: {
    actors: {
      name: "John"
    }
  }) {
    title
  }
}
----

Should be:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  movies(where: {
    actors_SOME: {
      name: "John"
    }
  }) {
    title
  }
}
----

And, instead of `_NOT`, `_NONE` should be used.

NOTE: Old queries will still work in this release, but are marked as `@deprecated` and will not be available in the future.

== `@ignore` directive renamed to `@computed`
To better reflect its intended usage, the `@ignore` directive is now named `@computed`. Behaviour is unchanged, so you just need to
rename this directive in your schema.

== Auth plugin system
Auth setup now relies on _plugins_ to setup the configuration. You'll need to install `@neo4j/graphql-plugin-auth` or a custom plugin
as shown in the xref::auth/getting-started.adoc[auth setup page].

=== JWT auth
For JWT authorization, instead of the previous configuration:
[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    config: {
        jwt: {
            secret
        }
    }
});
----

Now the configuration should be passed through `Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWTPlugin`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import { Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWTPlugin } from "@neo4j/graphql-plugin-auth";

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    plugins: {
        auth: new Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWTPlugin({
            secret: "super-secret"
        })
    }
});
----


=== JWKS decoding

https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets[JSON Web Key Sets] are now supported through `Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWKSPlugin`.

Instead of setting the endpoint directly:
[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    config: {
        jwt: {
            jwksEndpoint: "https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json"
        }
    }
});
----

Now the `Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWKSPlugin` would take care of that:
[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import { Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWKSPlugin } from "@neo4j/graphql-plugin-auth";

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    plugins: {
        auth: new Neo4jGraphQLAuthJWKSPlugin({
            jwksEndpoint: "https://YOUR_DOMAIN/well-known/jwks.json",
        })
    }
});
----

NOTE: Please, refer to xref::auth/getting-started.adoc[auth setup] before setting up auth.

== Types plurals changes
To improve consistency, some automatically generated plurals (e.g. `createActors`) have changed. This may cause issues if
your types use conventions such as `snake_case`.

Because of this, you may find generated queries and mutations may have different names. If you encounter this problem,
please update your clients to use the new query names or use the `plural` option in the xref::reference/directives/database-mapping.adoc#type-definitions-node[@node directive]
to force a custom plural value.

== Custom Directives
Defining and applying custom directives has changed significantly, if you are using or plan to use custom directives, make
sure to check the up-to-date documentation on xref::reference/directives/custom-directives.adoc[custom directives].

== Types changes
Some automatically generated types have changed to improve consistency.
These should not require any changes from most developers, unless types names are directly used.

=== Removal of nested operation fields for `connectOrCreate`
Input types for `onCreate` in `connectOrCreate` operations no longer accept relationship fields. They were originally added in error and did not function as one would expect, so there is no regression in functionality.

=== Non Nullable Aggregation Results
Aggregation results may now be non-nullable for required fields, yielding more accurate types.

For example, for the following types:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    name: String!
    lastName: String
}
----

Will yield different types for aggregations over `name` and `lastName`:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type UserAggregateSelection {
  count: Int!
  name: StringAggregateSelectionNonNullable!
  lastName: StringAggregateSelectionNullable!
}
----

=== ConnectionWhere types renamed
`ConnectionWhere` types renamed to improve consistency with other similarly named types.

== Neo4j support
Neo4j 4.1 is no longer supported in 3.0.0, inline with the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/neo4j-supported-versions/[supported versions list].

== GraphQL support
`graphql@^15.0.0` is no longer supported, please upgrade to `graphql@^16.0.0` using `npm` or the package manager of your choice.
