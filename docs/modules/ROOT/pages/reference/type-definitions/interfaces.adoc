= Interface Types

The Neo4j GraphQL Library supports the use of interfaces on relationship fields. This chapter will walk through their definition and usage.

== Type definitions

The following schema defines a `Actor` type, that has a relationship `ACTED_IN`, of type `[Production!]!`. `Production` is an interface type with `Movie` and `Series` implementations. Note in this example that relationship properties have also been used with the `@relationshipProperties` directive, so that interfaces representing relationship properties can be easily distinguished.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]!
}

type Movie implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
    runtime: Int!
}

type Series implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
    episodes: Int!
}

interface ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    role: String!
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Production!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, properties: "ActedIn")
}
----

These type definitions will be used for the rest of the examples in this chapter.

=== Directive inheritance

Any directives present on an interface or its fields will be "inherited" by any object types implementing it. For example, the type definitions above could be refactored to have the `@relationship` directive on the `actors` field in the `Production` interface instead of on each implementing type as it is currently:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
}

type Movie implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]!
    runtime: Int!
}

type Series implements Production {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actor!]!
    episodes: Int!
}

interface ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    role: String!
}

type Actor {
    name: String!
    actedIn: [Production!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, properties: "ActedIn")
}
----

==== Overriding

In addition to inheritance, directives can be overridden on a per-implementation basis. Say you had an interface defining some `Content`, with some basic authorization rules:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface Content
    @auth(rules: [{ operations: [CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE], allow: { author: { username: "$jwt.sub" } } }]) {
    title: String!
    author: [Author!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_CONTENT", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    username: String!
    content: [Content!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_CONTENT", direction: OUT)
}
----

You might implement this once for public content and once for private content which has additional rules in place:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type PublicContent implements Content {
    title: String!
    author: [Author!]!
}

type PrivateContent implements Content
    @auth(rules: [{ operations: [CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE], allow: { author: { username: "$jwt.sub" } } }]) {
    title: String!
    author: [Author!]!
}
----

The `PublicContent` type will inherit the auth rules from the `Content` interface, whilst the `PrivateContent` type will use the auth rules specified there.

In summary, there are three choices for the application of directives when using interfaces:

- Directives specified on the interface and inherited by all implementing types when the directives for every type are the same.
- Directives specified on the interface and overridden by certain implementing types when directives are broadly the same with a few discrepancies.
- Directives specified on implementing types alone when there is very little commonality between types, or certain types need a directive and others don't.

[[type-definitions-interfaced-types-querying]]
== Querying an interface

Which implementations are returned by a Query are dictated by the `where` filter applied.

For example, the following will return all productions with title starting "The " for every actor:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query GetProductionsStartingWithThe {
    actors {
        name
        actedIn(where: { node: { title_STARTS_WITH: "The " } }) {
            title
            ... on Movie {
                runtime
            }
            ... on Series {
                episodes
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Whilst the query below will only return the movies with title starting with "The " for each actor.

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query GetMoviesStartingWithThe {
    actors {
        name
        actedIn(where: { node: { _on: { Movie: { title_STARTS_WITH: "The " } } } }) {
            title
            ... on Movie {
                runtime
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This is to prevent overfetching, and you can find an explanation of this xref::troubleshooting.adoc#appendix-preventing-overfetching[here].

Alternatively, these implementation specific filters can be used to override filtering for a specific implementation. For example, if you wanted all productions with title starting with "The ", but movies with title starting with "A ", you could achieve this using the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query GetProductionsStartingWith {
    actors {
        name
        actedIn(where: { node: { title_STARTS_WITH: "The ", _on: { Movie: { title_STARTS_WITH: "A " } } } }) {
            title
            ... on Movie {
                runtime
            }
            ... on Series {
                episodes
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== Creating using an interface field

The below mutation creates an actor and some productions they've acted in:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateActorAndProductions {
    createActors(
        input: [
            {
                name: "Chris Pratt"
                actedIn: {
                    create: [
                        {
                            edge: {
                                role: "Mario"
                            }
                            node: {
                                Movie: {
                                    title: "Super Mario Bros"
                                    runtime: 90
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        {
                            edge: {
                                role: "Starlord"
                            }
                            node: {
                                Movie: {
                                    title: "Guardians of the Galaxy"
                                    runtime: 122
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        {
                            edge: {
                                role: "Andy"
                            }
                            node: {
                                Series: {
                                    title: "Parks and Recreation"
                                    episodes: 126
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    ) {
        actors {
            name
            actedIn {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== Nested interface operations

Operations on interfaces are abstract until you instruct them not to be. Take the following example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateActorAndProductions {
    updateActors(
        where: { name: "Woody Harrelson" }
        connect: {
            actedIn: {
                where: { node: { title: "Zombieland" } }
                connect: { actors: { where: { node: { name: "Emma Stone" } } } }
            }
        }
    ) {
        actors {
            name
            actedIn {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

The above Mutation will:

1. Find any `Actor` nodes with the name "Woody Harrelson"
2. Connect those nodes to any `Production` (`Movie` or `Series`) nodes with the title "Zombieland"
3. Connect the connected `Production` nodes to any `Actor` nodes with the name "Emma Stone"

As you can see, this is abstract all the way down. If you wanted to only connect `Movie` nodes to `Actor` nodes with name "Emma Stone", you could instead do:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateActorAndProductions {
    updateActors(
        where: { name: "Woody Harrelson" }
        connect: {
            actedIn: {
                where: { node: { title: "Zombieland" } }
                connect: { _on: { Movie: { actors: { where: { node: { name: "Emma Stone" } } } } } }
            }
        }
    ) {
        actors {
            name
            actedIn {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Likewise, you could move this up a level to make sure you only connect to `Movie` nodes with title "Zombieland":

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation CreateActorAndProductions {
    updateActors(
        where: { name: "Woody Harrelson" }
        connect: {
            actedIn: {
                where: { node: { _on: { Movie: { title: "Zombieland" } } } }
                connect: { actors: { where: { node: { name: "Emma Stone" } } } }
            }
        }
    ) {
        actors {
            name
            actedIn {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}
----
