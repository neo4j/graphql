= Custom Resolvers

The library will autogenerate Query and Mutation resolvers, so you donâ€™t need to implement those resolvers yourself. However, if you would like additional behaviours besides the autogenerated CRUD operations, you can specify custom resolvers for these scenarios.

== Custom object type field resolver

If you would like to add a field to an object type which is resolved from existing values in the type, rather than storing new values, you should mark it with the `@customResolver` directive (see below) and define a custom resolver for it. Take for instance a simple schema:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const typeDefs = `
    type User {
        firstName: String!
        lastName: String!
        fullName: String! @customResolver(requires: ["firstName", "lastName"])
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    User: {
        fullName(source) {
            return `${source.firstName} ${source.lastName}`;
        },
    },
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
});
----

Here `fullName` is a value that is resolved from the fields `firstName` and `lastName`. Specifying the `@customResolver` directive on the field definition keeps `fullName` from being included in any `Query` or `Mutation` fields and hence as a property on the `:User` node in the database.

The inclusion of the fields `firstName` and `lastName` in the `requires` argument means that in the definition of the resolver, the properties `firstName` and `lastName` will always be defined on the `source` object. If these fields are not specified, this cannot be guaranteed.

[[custom-resolver-directive]]
=== `@customResolver`

This field will essentially be completely ignored during the generation of Query and Mutation fields, and will require a custom resolver to resolve the field.

Any fields that the custom resolver depends on should be passed to the `requires` argument to ensure that during the Cypher generation process those properties are selected from the database.
Allowable fields are any returning a Scalar or Enum type including those defined using the xref::type-definitions/cypher.adoc#type-definitions-cypher[`@cypher`] directive.

==== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that a field will be resolved by a custom resolver, and allows specification of any field dependencies."""
directive @customResolver(
    """Fields that the custom resolver will depend on."""
    requires: [String!]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

Note that any field marked with the `@customResolver` directive, requires a custom resolver to be defined.
If the directive is marked on an interface, any implementation of that interface requires a custom resolver to be defined.
Take for example this schema:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
interface UserInterface {
    fullName: String! @customResolver
}

type User implements UserInterface {
    id: ID!
    fullName: String!
}
----

The following resolvers definition would be invalid:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const resolvers = {
    UserInterface: {
        fullName() {
            return "Hello World!";
        },
    },
};
----

Instead, the following resolvers definition would be required:
[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const resolvers = {
    User: {
        fullName() {
            return "Hello World!";
        },
    },
};
----

These checks may not always be required or desirable. If this is the case, they can be disabled using the `startupValidation` config option:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    config: {
        startupValidation: {
          resolvers: false
        },
    },
})
----

[[custom-resolvers-computed]]
=== `@computed`

NOTE: The `@computed` directive has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use the xref::custom-resolvers.adoc#custom-resolver-directive[`@customResolver` directive] instead.

This field will essentially be completely ignored during the generation of Query and Mutation fields, and will require another way to resolve the field, such as through the use of a custom resolver.

Any fields that the custom resolver depends on should be passed to the `from` argument to ensure that during the Cypher generation process those properties are selected from the database.
Allowable fields are any returning a Scalar or Enum type including those defined using the xref::type-definitions/cypher.adoc#type-definitions-cypher[`@cypher`] directive.

==== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Informs @neo4j/graphql that a field will be resolved by a custom resolver, and allows specification of any field dependencies."""
directive @computed(
    """Fields that the custom resolver will depend on."""
    from: [String!]
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

== Custom Query/Mutation type field resolver

You can define additional custom Query and Mutation fields in your type definitions and provide custom resolvers for them. A prime use case for this is using the xref::ogm/index.adoc[OGM] to manipulate types and fields which are not available through the API. You can find an example of it being used in this capacity in the xref::ogm/examples/custom-resolvers.adoc[Custom Resolvers] example.
